VAR celebrations, ice-hockey genius and a cat's NFL touchdown

Santos forward Marinho performs VAR celebration after scoring – video


Also featuring a Nicola Adams tribute, Emily Scarrat being brilliant at rugby and FA Vase scenes

1) The yin and yang of goal celebrations: none more modern than this one, from Brazil, in which the Santos forward Marinho mimics a VAR check after scoring but, far away from the world of contentious technology, check out what this last-minute FA Vase equaliser means for Falmouth Town’s players and fans. The visitors, Longlevens, had been 2-0 up going into second-half stoppage time. Falmouth eventually won 3-2 after extra-time.



2) Nicola Adams announced her retirement this week. The Yorkshire fighter was as popular a figure as British boxing has produced in recent years, so let’s reminds ourselves why: Here’s her London 2012 gold medal bout against China’s Ren Cancan in all its glory, and her reaction to it. Four years later in Rio, she did it again. Here’s the full fight from her last bout as a pro, against Maria Salinas in September.
3) We’re used to cats invading the pitch in English football grounds, wedged as they often are between rows of terraced houses, but less common is the sight of a moggy doing a lengthy run into the end zone at an NFL match. So, here’s to this furry feline entertaining the crowd at the Cowboys-Giants game! Golf’s always good for animal intruders, too. Here’s a top 10 for you.



4) Congratulations to England’s Emily Scarrat on being crowned women’s world rugby union player of the year last weekend. This is why she won, and here she is telling her story, and having a more trivial quickfire chinwag with James Haskell.
5) Yaya Touré gets sent off after only 10 seconds for kicking an opponent up the backside in a match for Qingdao Huanghai against Nantong Zhiyun in China. It’s certainly a good way to get out of 89 minutes and 50 seconds’ worth of running.
6) Andrei Svechnikov is the first NHL player in history to score the “Michigan” goal. It’s quite something. Can’t score from here, can he? We have more ice-hockey genius here, too, courtesy of Matthew Tkachuk.
Our favourites from below the line last week
1) James Ellison’s best save ever in British Superbikes.
2) Randy Mamola - great name, great rider, balls of steel.
