      <p>RAJKOT: The first T20I between India and Bangladesh in New Delhi was under constant threat of being affected by adverse weather conditions in the city. While the match went off without a hiccup at the end on Sunday, it now looks like the second T20I too might be under a cloud thanks to the weather in Rajkot.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Extremely-Severe-Cyclonic-Storm">Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm</a> (ESCS) Maha had seemingly moved away from the west coast of India till last Tuesday but it has since turned around and is heading towards the Gujarat coast.</p>
      <p>"And now, with a game in Rajkot ahead, news of a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vardah-Cyclone">cyclone</a> on the West coast on Nov 6/7 with a danger alert issued to fishermen on the Saurashtra coast. Hope it isn't dangerous for the people living there. The weather has been most unpredictable this year," said commentator <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harsha-Bhogle">Harsha Bhogle</a> in a tweet.</p>

      <p>However, the cyclone is expected to weaken on its way to the Gujarat coast, according to Skymet Weather. "The system is likely to make a landfall between Diu and Porbandar around November 7 and at that time the wind speed will be around 80-90 kmph gusting 100 kmph," said the report on the website.</p>
