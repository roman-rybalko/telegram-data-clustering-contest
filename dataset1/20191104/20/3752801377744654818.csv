""The police were on routine crime-prevention duties when they heard two gunshots. They rushed in the direction of the sound and found a 34-year-old male lying in a pool of blood. The victim was shot in the upper body and paramedics certified him dead on the scene,"" Peters added.

""It is alleged that a taxi driver had an argument with two pedestrians, he stopped his taxi and confronted them. One of the suspects took out a firearm and shot him.
""The police were given a description of the suspects and the direction they took. They used the information and arrested the two suspects within a very short space of time.""
According to Peters, the firearm used in the commission of the murder was seized and would be sent for ballistic testing to establish a possible link to other serious and violent crimes.
The suspects are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Monday.
