        <i>The new five-a-side rugby format captured a new audience when it debuted at the O2 Arena in London<br/>By <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-willacy">Gavin Willacy</a> for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></i>

      <p>It wasn’t rugby union and it wasn’t rugby league. It was indoors, it was five-a-side, it was strange and it was different. But Rugby X, which made its debut in London last week, was definitely rugby. Whether it’s here to stay or not remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>It had plenty of merits. More than 16,000 spectators turned up to the O2 Arena over afternoon and evening sessions on Tuesday and most of them seemed to enjoy themselves. They may not have seen the future of rugby but they did see tremendously talented players from around the world showing off some outlandish skills, all presented in the most modern way: with a booming soundtrack, darkness, spotlights, fire-shooters, the whole works.</p>
      <p>The game itself is like a warm-up at rugby training, played across the width of a 4G pitch. “It’s similar to just a game of tip, touch rugby just with the contact,” said Ireland youngster Sean Cregan, who scored in both the semi-final and final.” The general proportions and relationship between people and space seemed about right, much better than sevens on a full-size pitch, less space than nines. Most of the law changes made it a generic, simpler game: uncontested “fed” scrums, tap restarts with the defensive line back ten metres, no kicking to touch.</p>
      <p>At it’s worst it looked like a bad basketball game: one team attacks and scores, then the other do the same. At it’s best, it was entertaining and enjoyable. Some of the best contests came in the women’s matches, which had far more arm-wrestle than many of the more clinical men’s games. The women’s teams had to work harder for tries, going through multiple phases and tackles – partly because of their less sharp skill sets.</p>

      <p>“From a coaching perspective it’s a small-sided game,” said USA coach Mike Friday. “It’s not rugby in the purest sense. The atmosphere and fast-moving nature has appeal and there’s lots of great moments within a game. I don’t know where it could sit in the rugby landscape. It’s never going to compete with sevens or 15s.”</p>
      <p>Friday suggested it was more like <a href="https://www.balls.ie/football/ever-happened-masters-football-349730">Masters Football</a> or darts, and the O2’s presentation was heavily influenced by those events and the ATP Finals tennis. “It could work as a promotion tool. There’s certainly a gap in the rugby market for this kind of razzmatazz: a fun event, a fast-moving game which would appeal to the younger generation in the afternoon and the corporates and city boys in the evening. Then it’s how you attract the stars and convince coaches to release players to participate.”</p>
      <p>The players built most like basketball players fared the best. Ireland’s Cormac Izuchukwu – a tall teenager from Dublin – caught the eye throughout with five tries and some devastating runs. “It’s much tighter than sevens, so it suits guys like me,” said Izuchukwu. “I’m better when I get into contact and break out, especially when guys are cover tackling or lunging. I can step and spin out, and the players here are good at sucking in players so I get space on the other side.”</p>
      <p>Ireland, still in contention for a place at next year’s Olympics, were the surprise package. Former Munster youngster Greg O’Shea, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/30/its-a-national-disgrace-how-love-island-lost-its-heart">better known for winning Love Island this summer</a> (apparently) scored the third try in the semi-final and the second to get Ireland back into contention in the final. “Summer was great, but this is amazing,” he said – to some isolated high-pitched screams fro the crowd.</p>

      <p>Friday admitted his selection was all about the upcoming World Sevens series. “If I was looking at this in a serious competitive way I would bring a lot more taller, rangier players who could play through the contact area, like the Ireland No 4 [Izuchukwu], the Fijians and the long-limbed French boys, who caused problems. It suits that type of player. It’s narrower than you think, so doesn’t actually suit the racehorses.”</p>
      <p>Valuable skills included the ability to accelerate from an almost standing start, change direction, ideally sending three defenders heading off in the wrong direction like Benny Hill, leaving the field open. Sucking players into midfield and firing a cutout pass out wide was also key. Replacing the whole team halfway through the game, and every player after a sprint, became commonplace.</p>
      <p>The one-v-one shootouts after a draw were fun: 15 seconds to score and a point for a try or a tackle, first to three wins. It’s new and complicated enough to spoil the moment for the England women’s team: they didn’t realise they had won the final until quite a few seconds later, which was a shame.</p>
      <p>With no half time, the 10-minute games flew by, leaving us older spectators bewildered. Despite marketers telling us everything needs to be quicker and shorter, sport needs time to breathe. Football takes nearly two hours to complete with the ball only in play for about an hour – and it seems to be quite popular. I also don’t recall any player celebrate scoring a try. There were few smiles or clenched fists. They just legged it back 10 metres into the defensive line. With few one-on-one collisions there were noticeably few stoppages for injuries, either.</p>

      <p>Not many spectators would have recognised more than a handful of players. It was bizarre that there were no programmes, team sheets, announcements or even line-ups on the big screen, as if organisers wanted to keep secret who was playing.</p>
      <p>The considerable marketing budget – with adverts around London and broadcast on ITV – seemed to pay dividends. With many schools on half-term, kids and women dominated the crowd in the afternoon. The atmosphere was rather different in the evening session, when groups of blokes swarmed to the O2 for a beer-fuelled rugby fix after work in the city.</p>
      <p>Folk dribbling into the arena for the evening kick-off time advertised on Twitter will have missed England men altogether. By then Swing Low had been silenced by Argentina scoring at will. They ran in 11 tries in 10 minutes, the first 10 of which were scored by 10 different players – in a 55-15 annihilation.</p>
      <p>After a high quality semi-final, the compere brought on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Vickerman">Rob Vickerman</a> to explain to the crowd a controversial decision which had seen Argentina beat France after the hooter. The final was rather an anti-climax as the Pumas beat Ireland 25-15 to muted applause and a mass, rushed exodus.</p>
      <p>The format would suit rugby league teams, who would only have to learn the specific tactics at the breakdown. Few attacks got as far as six phases. Just like the World Cup Nines, no one knows whether, where or when there will be another Rugby X. The promoters are talking about taking the concept around the world. They should approach Super League and the NRL. I could see five-figure crowds packing arenas in Manchester or Leeds, Sydney or Brisbane to watch pre-season or post-season events featuring the biggest club sides. Maybe that’s something Ben Ryan and the promoters should consider if Rugby X is here to stay.</p>
