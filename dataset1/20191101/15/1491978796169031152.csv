Sheffield United v Burnley: match preview
01 Nov 2019, 15:59 by Guardian Staff
It is a measure of how tight mid-table is that although Sheffield United currently stand eighth, they are only one point ahead of 13th-placed Burnley. Under the expert leadership of two excellent English managers in Chris Wilder and Sean Dyche both teams are exceeding expectations. Wilder and Dyche have been close since the early 1990s and took a golf trip together in the summer but neither man will be wanting to do his friend a favour. An intriguing tactical duel beckons.
