01 Nov 2019, 19:58

Every holiday season, retailers sell a ton of wallets, ties, and sports-themed sweatshirts to people shopping for gifts for guys. They'll always be gift staples, but they're not particularly creative. When it comes to what gifts guys actually want, picking from the gems on this list are far more unique options
The gifts included on this list will appeal to a number of different interests, so no matter what the man you're shopping for is into, you're covered.

In other words: None of that stereotypical, here-is-a-GrillMaster-for-Christmas-because-you-are-a-man-and-that's-what-men-like-BS. (Although, there is a grill on this list, because some men do like grills, and that's fine too. Everyone can like what they like!) Everyone can express themselves in ways that both embrace and defy gender identity, if that is what they so wish to do.
