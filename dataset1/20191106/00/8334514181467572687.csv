NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slid and the three-day global stock market rally paused on Wednesday as U.S. productivity data disappointed and investors turned a bit cautious about U.S.-China trade talks.


Earnings, data fail to lift share-market moodEuropean shares took a breather on Wednesday after closing at a four-year peak in the previous session, as a mixed bag of earnings reports and weak services sector data from the euro zone weighed on sentiment. David Pollard reports.

MSCI’s All Country World Index, eased and benchmark U.S. Treasury prices gained following a three-day sell-off. U.S. Government data showed American workers were unexpectedly less productive during the third quarter.
Global equity markets have rallied on a reduced recession outlook, optimism a “phase one” U.S.-China trade deal can be reached this month and as global business surveys indicate tariff-hit manufacturing sentiment has troughed.
France’s benchmark 10-year bond yield FR10YT-RR turned positive for the first time since July, a further sign that pessimism is abating in world bond markets.
Investors said lingering concerns about the U.S.-China trade talks had stock markets consolidating gains made recently.
“What you saw over the last two days is a bit of confusion on the China phase one deal ... and that started affecting risk appetite,” said Juan Perez, a senior currency trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.
Traders and investors hope a preliminary deal will roll back at least some of the punitive tariffs Washington and Beijing have imposed on each other’s goods. But it remained uncertain when or where U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign an agreement.
European stocks edged higher, boosted by gains in financial stocks as investors assessed a mixed bag of earnings reports.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.21%. [.EU]Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE index rose 0.12%, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI and France's CAC 40 .FCHI added 0.24% and 0.34%, respectively.

The U.S. Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 0.3% annualized rate in the third quarter, the biggest decline in almost four years.
