She and her husband were evacuated for four nights as firefighters battled the Kincade Fire, which reached the edge of their neighborhood. The fire was the largest to burn over a three-week siege of gusty winds that fanned fast-moving wildfires across California and led utility companies to cut power to millions to prevent breezes from blowing branches into electric lines and igniting an inferno.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Crews are battling the last remaining large wildfire in Southern California as stubborn flames threaten nearly 2,000 homes.
The Maria Fire headed for what would be its third day Saturday after erupting on a Ventura County hilltop northeast of Los Angeles.
Nearly 11,000 people are under evacuation orders. Fire officials say the communities of Eastern Ventura, Camarillo, Somis and Santa Paula are at risk.
The cause is under investigation but Southern California Edison, which cut power to many areas this week to prevent wildfires, said Friday that it had re-energized a power line just minutes before the fire began nearby.
Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger from winds and ultra-low humidity have been extended into Saturday evening for some areas of LA and Ventura counties.
