      <p>President Trump's personal lawyer and fixer, Rudy Giuliani, found himself at the heart of the impeachment hearing on Wednesday after the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, implicated him in <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879653/sondland-confirms-quid-pro-quo-points-finger-directly-trump">allegedly setting up a quid pro quo</a> between the White House and Ukraine. Giuliani, needless to say, was not having it, going as far as to demand an apology from the GOP's own attorney.</p>
      <p>Republicans had attempted to dismiss Giuliani's activities in Ukraine as nothing but <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878835/associates-allege-rudy-giuliani-partner-major-ukrainian-energy-project">self-interested meddling</a>, as to distance Trump from the possible scheme to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens. That was the line of questioning the GOP counsel, Steve Castor, pursued on Wednesday: "Granted, Mr. Giuliani had business interests in Ukraine," Castor suggested, prompting Sondland to answer "now I understand he did; I didn't know that at the time."</p>

      <p>Giuliani hit back on Twitter: "Republican lawyer doesn't do his own research and preparation, and is instead picking up Democrat lies, shame," <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1197224271887634432">he tweeted</a>. "Allow me to inform him: I have NO financial interests in Ukraine, NONE! I would appreciate his apology."</p>
      <p>Giuliani spent the day on the defensive on social media, tweeting earlier that "I never met with [Sondland]" and that there was "no quid pro quo." He later deleted that tweet.
