      <p>A former Director-General of the National Sports Commission, Gbenga Elegbeleye, has called for a thorough examination of football administration in Nigeria as a response to the national teams’ dwindling fortunes.</p>
      <p>Elegbeleye told <i>News Agency of Nigeri</i>a  on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Age-grade and women’s football have always been our strength and we particularly do well in those tournaments. But here we are not booking qualification for international age-grade and women’s competition,“he said.</p>
      <p>He alleged that football administrators these days bring in their clients, cronies and kinsmen to manage the affairs of the country`s national teams.</p>
      <p>“I am not happy about the tragedy that befell our national teams this year,” he said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the most recent football under-performance by Nigeria came when five-time champions, the Golden Eaglets, failed to go beyond the round of 16 at the U-17 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Before then, the home-based Super Eagles also failed to qualify for the  Africa Nations Championship in Cameroon in January 2020.</p>
      <p>The national U-23 team, the Olympic Eagles, also failed to book a Tokyo 2020 ticket, as they could not go beyond the group stage at U-23 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>The women’s national teams haven’t fared better either. The Super Falcons didn’t qualify for the Olympics, as they were beaten to the ticket by Cote D’Ivoire in Oct.</p>
      <p>Elegbeleye, who was a member of the 2011 Ministerial Committee on Reform of Football Administration in Nigeria, said only a careful and complete overhaul of the system would curtail further underachievement.</p>
      <p>Sunday Dare, Minister of Youth and Sports Development, had on Monday met with the board of the Nigeria Football Federation.</p>
      <p>The minister demanded a written explanation over the “dismal” exit of the country’s teams from four football tournaments.</p>
      <p>But Elegbeleye stated that the minister should go beyond demanding an explanation.</p>
      <p>“We need a complete overhauling of football administration in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“With all due respect to the current board of the NFF – I do not have any problem with the board – football is not Nollywood.</p>
      <p>“It takes effective and efficient football administration to deliver success in every aspect of the football value chain.</p>
      <p>“Football matches are won on the pitch by players through the input of the technical crew, but football successes are engineered and recorded in the boardroom.</p>
      <p>“We need to sit up and tell ourselves some hard truth that football is not showbiz. Grandstanding and showmanship can’t earn us success in the game,” he said.</p>
      <p>He, however, acknowledged that the men’s senior national team, the Super Eagles, were at the heart of whatever went well for Nigerian football in 2019.</p>
      <p>“Yes, the Super Eagles are about the only success story in Nigerian football this year.</p>
      <p>“They got to the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations and have so far recorded 100 per cent success rate in the 2021 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>“However, they have only played Benin Republic and Lesotho.</p>
      <p>“For me, their true test comes when they play fellow African powerhouses such as Senegal, Ghana and Algeria. Benin and Lesotho victories are routine,” he said.</p>
