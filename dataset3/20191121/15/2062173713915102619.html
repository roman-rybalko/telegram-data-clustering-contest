      <p>THE SYMBOLISM of the venue clanged as clear as a temple bell. For his inauguration on November 18th Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the newly elected president of Sri Lanka, chose a sacred shrine in the ancient capital of Anuradhapura. The massive stupa houses relics of the Buddha. More pointedly, in a country often troubled by sectarian rifts, it commemorates the defeat in 140 BC of Elara, a Tamil Hindu king, and the reunification of Sri Lanka under his Sinhalese Buddhist rival, King Dutugemunu.</p>
      <p>The ceremony felt like a coronation. The vast mound of the stupa gleamed white, as did the shirts of Mr Rajapaksa’s supporters, setting off the crimson of the processional carpet and of the robes of shaven-headed Buddhist monks thronging to bestow their blessing. Crimson is also a brand marker for the Rajapaksas, chosen by the new president’s uncle to represent the famed red finger millet of their home region in the south of the island.</p>
      <p>Mr Rajapaksa won 52% of the vote despite a crowded field. His victory was expected. His family has been in politics since the 1930s. When his brother, Mahinda, this generation’s senior Rajapaksa, ran the country as president from 2005 to 2015, Gotabaya served as his defence chief. He earned a nickname—the Terminator—by overseeing a swift and brutal conclusion to the 26-year civil war. The conflict had pitted a vicious and tenacious Tamil separatist group against the state, which is dominated by Sinhala-speaking Buddhists, who are 70% of the population.</p>
      <h3>I’ll be back</h3>
      <p>Sinhalese duly voted for Mr Rajapaksa in huge numbers. His main rival, Sajith Premadasa, although himself Sinhalese and the son of a former president assassinated by Tamil rebels, scored barely 30% in the southern, largely Sinhalese part of the country. In the Tamil-dominated north, Mr Premadasa earned some 80% of votes, despite largely ignoring Tamil concerns.</p>
      <p>Ethnic rifts were not nearly as visible when the older Mr Rajapaksa was ousted in an electoral upset in 2015 by a coalition of reform-minded Sinhalese and frightened minorities. He could not run for president again this time, because the term limits that he had abolished had been reinstated by the outgoing government in an effort to trim executive powers he was widely seen to have abused.</p>
      <p>Mahinda (Sri Lankans habitually refer to politicians by first names) is back again anyway. Rather than linger as a lame duck, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the prime minister and long-time political opponent of the Rajapaksa clan, resigned. Mahinda will take over as interim prime minister until parliamentary elections are held, probably in March.</p>
      <p>With the momentum of victory behind them and a third brother, Basil, having built the family electoral vehicle, the Sri Lanka People’s Front, into a formidable machine, the Rajapaksas are expected to sail to an easy parliamentary majority. Should that be as big as two-thirds—and many analysts think it will be—the Rajapaksas would not just control the presidency and parliament, but be able to revise the constitution, bolstering the power of the executive however they like.</p>
      <p>To many Sinhalese the prospect of such total dominance by a single clan is appealing. This is not just because of the Rajapaksas’ charms, deep pockets, lingering influence in state institutions such as the army and police, and their digitally savvy ground game. Two other factors have helped whet voters’ appetites for strongman rule.</p>
      <p>One was the perceived dither and incompetence of the outgoing government. This was perpetually hamstrung by petty rivalry between the calculating Mr Wickremesinghe and the little-lamented departing president, Maithripala Sirisena, a former camp-follower of the Rajapaksas who destructively lashed out against his relegation to a figurehead role. The shock of multiple Islamist terror attacks on churches and hotels on Easter Sunday, which left 268 people dead, underscored the dysfunction. Despite plenty of prior intelligence, security agencies failed either to communicate the danger or take preventive action. “The outgoing government itself fostered the argument for a stronger government,” says Jayadeva Uyangoda, a political scientist.</p>
      <p>Fears inspired by the Easter attacks added substance to another factor that has boosted the Rajapaksas: a persistent and widespread narrative of Sinhalese victimhood. This seems silly, given their numerical superiority: Tamils are just 15% of the population, and Muslims a mere 10%. But ancient rivalry with Tamils, added to almost 500 years of Portuguese, Dutch and British rule, plus the rise of successful cosmopolitan minorities such as Muslim traders and English-speaking Christian professionals, has generated “nativist” resentment. Building on their reputation as the heroes who beat the Tamils, the Rajapaksas have cheerfully allowed Buddhist extremists to whisper on their behalf. “The message that went out through temples everywhere was: ‘This is the only country we have, and we must save it from the Tamils and the Muslims’,” says a minister from the outgoing government. “They really took the genie out of the bottle.”</p>
      <p>Many Sinhalese would dismiss such talk as alarmist. Two of the most notoriously chauvinist groups, led by right-wing Buddhist monks and blamed for stoking repeated sectarian riots, have declared that they will dissolve themselves, their job apparently done. “We feel that after 71 years [since independence] during which the Sinhala race was being degraded and humiliated, we finally have a leader we can trust,” declared the leader of one group, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara.</p>
      <p>If the symbolism of Mr Rajapaksa’s inauguration was not reassuring to Tamils, nor was his pick of General Kamal Gunaratne as defence minister. In the closing days of the war, Mr Gunaratne commanded an elite unit that hunted Tamil leaders, gaining a reputation for egregious cruelty. Mr Rajapaksa scorns Tamil demands for a federation and has pledged to stop war-crimes investigations. But Malinda Seneviratne, a commentator seen as close to the Rajapaksas, says tut-tutting about war records is a preoccupation of only the English-speaking elite. “The last government just lied to Tamils and gave them nothing, so what’s wrong if Gota calls a spade a spade?” he asks. “As for the defence minister, are you going to get a soft guy to do the job when ISIS is blowing things up here?” ■</p>
