        <b>Tottenham Hotspur like Ruben Dias a lot. The English press state this, but they also make it clear that the Lodon club will not sign anyone in the winter market. Spurs will go for the young centre-back, from Benfica, in the summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> will have to sign central defenders whether they want to or not. <b>Alderweireld and Vertonghen</b> only have a little more than six months left on their contracts, amd since they don't look like they're going to renew, replacements are in order.</p>

      <p>According to the 'Independent', the player Spurs have chosen is young, Benfica centre-back, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/ruben-dias-277401/">Ruben Dias</a>, who is only <b>22-years-old</b>. The Portuguese, wanted by many<b> big European clubs,</b> will also now try and be tempted by Spurs.</p>
      <p>What <b>Tottenham</b> don't look like they will be doing is going in for him in the<b> winter transfer market</b>. The London club will wait for <b>the summer to pounce,</b> but given their well-known need to sign and <b>big competition</b> for the youngster, it will be very difficult.</p>
