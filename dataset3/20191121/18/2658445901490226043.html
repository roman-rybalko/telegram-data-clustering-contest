      <p>Pan-Afenifere leader Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has urged Nigerian leaders to borrow a leaf from the examples of the late elder statesman Chief Alfred Rewane; the late Yoruba leader Chief Bola Ige and the late Dr Stella Adadevoh, credited with having curbed a wider spread of the Ebola virus in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The trio and their contributions of nation-building were “resurrected” at the formal unveiling of accountant-turned-poet Wisdom Dafinone’s poetry collections Thursday at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA).</p>
      <p>The author has immortalised the three with his poems eulogising their deeds.</p>
      <p>It had in attendance dignitaries from different fields.</p>

      <p>For Pa Adebanjo, “Celebrating the late Chief Bola, Chief Alfred Rewane and Dr Stella Adadevoh is a worthy move to honour them. These are the people who laid the foundation of what we have today. So it is good that the poet has remembered and celebrated them. Many do not remember such people. It is a good thing to give honour to whom honour is due,” he said.</p>
      <p>The main highlight of the event, which was chaired by former Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos (UNILAG), had the children of Rewane and Ige – Muyiwa and Eriwu – reading the poems dedicated to their fathers.</p>
      <p>“I thank the author for honouring the memory of our late father, Chief Bola Ige, SAN, of blessed memory with the poem. When on the 30th of July I received a phone call and subsequently an email from Wisdom  Dafinone read this poem, I was overwehelmed with emotion that my father’s memory is kept alive 18 years later,” Ige’s son, Muyiwa, said.</p>
