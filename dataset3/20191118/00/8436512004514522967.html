      <h1>Google enters battle for cloud gaming market</h1>
      <h2>Stadia cloud service lets people play console-quality video games on a web browser or smartphone</h2>

      <p>Ever-expanding Google becomes a gaming company Tuesday with the launch of its Stadia cloud service that lets people play console-quality video games on a web browser or smartphone.</p>
      <p>The internet giant hopes to break into the global video game industry – expected to top $150 billion this year – with cloud technology that could broaden audiences attracted by rich new features as well as ease of access with no more need for consoles.</p>
      <p>But analysts say Stadia’s outlook is uncertain as its faces rivals such as PlayStation Now in an emerging and highly-competitive market.</p>
      <p>Stadia plays into a trend in which content – ranging from blockbuster films to work projects – lives in the cloud and is accessible from any device.</p>
      <p>“All of these new services are merely pointing out that we don’t need sophisticated hardware in the home to access entertainment,” said Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Michael Pachter.</p>
      <p>Google last month sold out of “Founder’s Edition” kits, which are priced at $129.</p>
      <p>Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.</p>
      <p>Stadia games are playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers.</p>
      <p>Stadia also works with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward, and on televisions.</p>
      <p>Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at $10 a month in the US, will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe.</p>
      <h3>All in the game</h3>
      <p>But analysts say Stadia could wind up as another “bet” that Google walks away from if it fails to live up to expectations.</p>
      <p>“Stadia will live or die by its content,” said Ovum senior analyst George Jijiashvili. “The announced 12 launch titles are underwhelming.”</p>
      <p>Subscribers will be able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data centers, but some free games will be available to subscribers, starting with “Destiny 2: The Collection.”</p>
      <p>Stadia on smartphones will work with WiFi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services.</p>
      <p>Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be.</p>
      <p>Some promised features such as integration with YouTube will not be in place at launch.</p>
      <p>“Stadia appears to be rushed out the door before fully ready and, worryingly, Google is risking falling short on its promises,” Jijiashvili said.</p>
      <p>“These shortcomings however would be easily overlooked if Google can deliver a very reliable and high-quality game streaming service.”</p>
      <p>Google appears committed to doing just that, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early.</p>
      <p>The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.</p>
      <p>“From what I have seen, their plans are too deep; they are too good, and they are too invested,” Early said. “They are not calling it quits any time soon.”</p>
      <p>He expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.</p>
      <p>“If there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn’t the end of the world; it isn’t even close,” he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.</p>
      <p>But Pachter questioned whether subscriptions were the right approach.</p>
      <p>“The right model is pay as you go or pay for the game and play unlimited without a subscription,” Pachter said.</p>
      <p>“Amazon will try one of those and will win the streaming wars.”</p>
      <p>Amazon has game studios but no online game service.</p>
      <h3>Battle brewing</h3>
      <p>US technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform.</p>
      <p>“Next year, we’ll bring Project xCloud to Windows PCs, and are collaborating with a broad set of partners to make game streaming available on other devices as well,” Microsoft corporate vice president Kareem Choudhry said in an online post.</p>
      <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment last month slashed the price of its PlayStation Now cloud video game service by about half in the US to $10 monthly.</p>
      <p>Japan-based Sony also boosted the library of games that PlayStation Now users can access through its consoles or on personal computers powered by Windows software.</p>
      <p>Sony and Microsoft are also poised to release new-generation video game consoles next year.</p>
      <p>“While we expect dedicated consoles to eventually lose relevance in the face of cloud gaming services, there’s no guarantee that it will be Google’s service – rather than Sony and Microsoft’s – that catalyzes this trend,” said Ovum senior analyst Matthew Bailey.</p>
