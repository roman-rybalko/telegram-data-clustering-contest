      <p>A Kumasi Circuit Court has remanded a 37-year-old steel bender for allegedly defiling a 12-year-old girl, on three separate occasions.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Addae, the accused, pleaded not guilty and would reappear before the Court presided over by Miss Comfort Tasiame, on November 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Police Chief Inspector Mercy Quaye, told the Court that the complainant, Mary Osei, is unemployed and grandmother to the victim who resides at Kwadaso Estate, Kumasi, whiles the accused, a friend to the complainant’s family, also resides at Patasi, Kumasi.</p>
      <p>He said on 31st October, 2019, the victim returned from school and complained of severe pains in her private part.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said upon interrogation by the grandmother, the victim disclosed that the accused person defiled her on three separate occasions in the month of October.</p>
      <p>She said two of these incidents took place in the grandmother’s room on the- 20th and 24th and that on those occasions the accused came to the house when she was alone.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Quaye said on 29th October, 2019 the accused person again lured the victim to where he (accused) lives and had another bout of sexual intercourse with her on a bare floor in a corridor, when there was no one in that house.</p>
      <p>She said the complainant then reported the incident to the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) at the Suntreso Police Station in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said the complainant was issued a medical report form to send the victim to any government hospital for examination and treatment.</p>
      <p>She said the complainant returned with the medical report form duly endorsed by a medical officer at Suntreso Government Hospital.</p>
      <p>She said the accused was later arrested and detained to help in investigations.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Inspector Quaye said accused was subsequently charged and brought before the Court.</p>
