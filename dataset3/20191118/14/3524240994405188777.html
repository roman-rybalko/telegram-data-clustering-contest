      <h1>Court adjourns trial of Port Harcourt ‘serial killer’</h1>

      <p>A Nigerian court on Monday adjourned the trial of a suspected serial killer accused of strangling 10 women to death in ritual-style murders after drugging them at hotels.</p>
      <p>Gracious David West, 26, in October admitted to nine of the killings in the city of Port Harcourt after the bodies of his alleged victims were found with a white cloth wrapped around their necks and waist.</p>
      <p>The murders sparked outrage and prompted women to take to the streets of Port Harcourt, the heart of Nigeria’s oil-rich south, to demand better police protection.</p>
      <p>A judge suspended the trial to Thursday after prosecutors said they needed more time to prepare because they had only received the case file from the police last week.</p>
      <p>West appeared in court in handcuffs, wearing a green prison uniform and a plastic bracelet from an evangelical church, an<i> AFP j</i>ournalist said.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Zacchaeus Adango said that the police dossier also contained evidence against a second suspect called Nimi Thankgod, who should appear at the next hearing.</p>
      <p>Port Harcourt and the surrounding region has one of the highest crime rates in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>It is rife with so-called cults, criminal gangs that emerged from university campuses to become organised crime groups and frequently engage in blood rituals and oaths.</p>
      <p>Police have said West was a confessed cult member and released a video of him on Twitter confessing to the crimes after his arrest in September.</p>
