It also fits comfortably in the hand, putting all apps within easy reach.

      <p>The dual battery capacity is a game-changer that uses and recharges both cells to prevent overcharging. To save power, the intelligent battery management puts apps not in use on reserve.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the six pro-grade cameras, users are sure to capture stunning photos and videos.</p>
