      <h1>Jose Mourinho to Arsenal: No meetings held yet with former Manchester United and Chelsea boss</h1>
      <h2>A round-up of the latest stories and rumours regarding Jose Mourinho's future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:45:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha, Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been linked with numerous jobs since he left Manchester United almost a year ago.</p>
      <p>With Real Madrid stuttering under Zinedine Zidane for some time and a positive relationship with Florentino Perez said to be still in effect, it was only natural that his name would crop up.</p>
      <p>And Spurs have also been linked to the former Chelsea boss, with Mauricio Pochettino's side floundering in the bottom half of the Premier League amid a poor run of form and some rumblings of discontent from the Argentine coach.</p>
      <p>Reports have suggested that Mourinho is keen to take over another job in the Premier League and become the first manager to win major honours with three different English sides.</p>
      <p>With Unai Emery's position under scrutiny at Arsenal, he has also been linked with the top job at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>What do we know about his future? Here are the latest stories.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho's one demand</h3>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> revealed he was ready for a return to management - but on one condition.</p>
      <p>And that's to manage a club where the aim is to win.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I know is what I don't want," Mourinho told the <a href="https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice/status/1169655933028503552">Coaches' Voice</a>. "What I don't want is crystal clear.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"What I want - the general profile of it of course - but I cannot say clubs and country. I am quite pathological in this sense that I have to play to win.</p>
      <p>"Then if I win or don't win it's my problem, the players, the club and the structure. But I need a project where the feeling is that I play to win.</p>
      <p>"If someone gives me a wonderful, incredible, amazing 10-year contract and the objective of the team is to stay in the first part of the table, If you finish seventh or eighth or ninth is perfect that's not for me. That's my nature."</p>

      <h3>La Liga hint</h3>
      <p>Less than a week after that interview, Mourinho dropped a major hint that he was set for a return to La Liga six years after leaving Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing for me is that my next role is with an elite club that has an ambition which challenges and excites me," <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/former-chelsea-man-united-boss-16919270">he said</a>. "I miss coaching a lot, but I won’t return to working just for the sake of coaching again.</p>
      <p>"I love La Liga and the pride I have to have won this fantastic league is massive.</p>

      <p>"I may have left six years ago but trust me, spiritually, and in the manner I speak of La Liga, I am an ambassador even without the official title of ambassador."</p>

      <h3>Zidane speaks out</h3>
      <p>Amid links with a return to the Santiago Bernabeu, current Los Blancos boss Zinedine Zidane appeared unbothered.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't annoy me that his name is linked, that's how it is," the Frenchman <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/what-zinedine-zidane-said-ex-16959943">said</a>. "I don't have to say if it annoys me or not, that's the situation.</p>
      <p>"Here, you lose a game and you have to change something. It's difficult, but that's the reality."</p>
      <h3>Wenger dig</h3>
      <p>It's little surprise that Arsenal fans are split on Mourinho. Those who are against the 'Special One' replacing Emery are probably big supporters of Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>And that stance isn't going to change if Mourinho continues to poke fun at his old rival.</p>
      <p>The problem is, he can't resist a dig.</p>
      <p>After being named ambassador for Paddy Power Games, Mourinho starred in a TV advert and whilst donning a suit poked fun at Wenger.</p>
      <p>"Special is effortless," he says, before the camera focuses on a bookshelf as he walks past, in which is seen a book entitled 'Le Specialiste En Failure'.</p>
      <p>Of course this is in reference to Mourinho once labelling Wenger "a specialist in failure".</p>
      <h3>Ozil reunion</h3>
      <p>Despite being named in the squad to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup tonight, Mesut Ozi's future at Arsenal remains unclear.</p>
      <p>At least while Emery is still in charge.</p>
      <p>Yet, he could enjoy a new lease of life if he was reunited with Mourinho - who he worked under at Real Madrid.</p>

      <p>Ozil enjoyed one of his most productive seasons under Mourinho, and has made no secret of his excellent relationship with him.</p>
      <p>According to Opta, his overall record of assists per game under Mourinho is 0.46 per game</p>

      <h3>Mourinho's 'assurances'</h3>
      <p>A manager of Mourinho's calibre would obviously seek some assurances before accepting a job offer.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/arsenal/story/3976965/sources-jose-mourinho-open-to-replacing-unai-emery-at-arsenal">ESPN</a> claim the Portuguese tactician would want one thing from Josh Kroenke, Raul Sanllehi and Edu...</p>
      <p>...Funds.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article15884762.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Jose-Mourinho.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Jose Mourinho gives a thumbs up (Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The report states that Mourinho would want assurances from the board that funds were available to allow a serious challenge at silverware.</p>
      <h3>Truth about Mourinho's 'dinner' with Raul Sanllehi</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/arsenal-set-their-sights-on-jose-mourinho-95rwpx0r6">The Times</a>, Arsenal have begun preparing the ground for a change of management, with 'fractures' appearing between Unai Emery and members of the playing squad.</p>
      <p>The report claims Arsenal are looking for a manager with strong knowledge of the Premier League who can bring an identity to a squad who were reassembled at significant expense in the summer window.</p>
      <p>And that they are considering a move for Jose Mourinho who dined with head of football Raul Sanllehi last week.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>However, <b>football.london</b> understands Sanllehi did not have dinner with Mourinho and has not spoken to the former Chelsea manager in years.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho to Bayern Munich?</h3>
      <p>The big news coming out of Germany last month was Bayern Munich parting company with Niko Kovac following a 5-1 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was heavily linked with the vacant position, and so was his long-term rival Pep Guardiola recently.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho has been tipped for the role by former Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/article16863636.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Jose-Mourinho.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I can imagine Mourinho in Germany," the former Manchester United star <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/bastian-schweinsteiger-suggests-its-time-for-thomas-m%C3%BCller-to-leave-bayern-munich/a-51097264">said</a>. "I remember he was always asking me about Bayern and the Bundesliga. During our away games, there was always Bundesliga on TV.</p>
      <p>"He really knew every single player, even from the smaller teams. He was also learning German."</p>
      <h3>'Discussions' with Arsenal</h3>
      <p>French outlet <a href="https://twitter.com/SoccerLink_/status/1192027342614474752">Soccerlink</a> claimed Jose Mourinho was in discussions with Arsenal over a potential move.</p>
      <p>With former Gunners boss Arsene Wenger becoming the new favourite to take the Bayern Munich job, Mourinho's options appear to have reduced and the website claims the former Manchester United boss is in talks with the north London side.</p>
      <p><b>football.london</b> understands that this is not the case, however, and Unai Emery's job is safe for now, with the Arsenal hierarchy reluctant to make a managerial change in the middle of the season.</p>
      <h3>Victor Lindelof's admission</h3>
      <p>Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof says he misses working under Jose Mourinho and believes it won't be long before the former Chelsea and United manager returns to football management.</p>
      <p>"He is, after all, one of the world’s best coaches and he is supposed to have a job at one of the biggest clubs. I miss him in football," Lindelof told <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/zGzjXr/lindelof-jag-ville-inte-visa-hur-orolig-jag-var"><i>Aftonbladet</i></a>.</p>

        <figcaption>Victor Lindelof of Manchester United<cite>(Image: Yong Teck Lim/International Champions Cup/Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"He's a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything.</p>
      <p>"I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug.</p>
      <p>"Even if I did not agree, at the time… he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him.</p>
      <p>"He's won everything. When he says something, you listen."</p>
      <h3>Tottenham rumours</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/exclusive-time-running-pochettinos-tottenham-reign/">The Telegraph</a>, Mauricio Pochettino is heading towards the point of 'no return' in north London, as fears grow that the Argentinian will not be able to turn Spurs' fortunes around.</p>
      <p>Tottenham face fierce rivals West Ham after the international break, a game which could prove decisive for Pochettino's future.</p>
      <p>The report claims Spurs could turn to Massimiliano Allegri or Jose Mourinho if they were to appoint a replacement mid-season, but making a change at the end of the campaign could see Daniel Levy target Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe, RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann, or England manager Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho talks to friends about Spurs job</h3>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has reportedly told friends that he would consider taking over at Tottenham ahead of Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is under pressure after a poor run of results and performances, and former Chelsea manager Mourinho has been linked with replacing the Spurs boss should he leave.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane's position at Real Madrid is also under scrutiny, with his return not having the desired effect.</p>
      <p>And according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360791/jose-mourinho-tottenham-pochettino-real-madrid/">the Sun</a>, Mourinho has doubts over potentially taking the Madrid role with much uncertainty surrounding Pochettino's position in north London.</p>
      <h3>No discussions between Mourinho and Arsenal</h3>
      <p>And French outlet <a href="https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/mercato-real-madrid-lavenir-de-mourinho-serait-deja-tout-trace-481471?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Le10 Sport</a> have now stated that no discussions have been held between Arsenal and Mourinho, as <b>football.london</b> had earlier reported.</p>
      <figure>

          <cite>(Image: OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images)</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They also state that Arsenal's 'executive committee' have no plans to remove Unai Emery as manager.</p>
      <p>Mourinho would reportedly consider a move to Spurs if Pochettino were to leave, but he is apparently "destined" to end up back at Real Madrid when Zidane (or Perez) decides enough is enough for a second time.</p>
      <p>Perez will apparently "always keep an eye on Mourinho".</p>
