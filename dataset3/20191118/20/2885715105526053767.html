      <p>THE Samta Nagar police on Sunday arrested a 25-year-old man for allegedly molesting, murdering and dumping the body of a 14-year-old girl in Palghar. The incident took place on October 1 and the accused managed to give police the slip for one-and-a-half months. Police caught him by tracking the phone number he was using, which gave away his location in Palghar.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the accused was from Uttar Pradesh and came to Mumbai eight years ago. He has a business of shoe-repairing.</p>
      <p>The police said the accused and the victim stayed in the same neighbourhood and he knew that her parents went out on work from 12 noon to 4 pm. On October 1 after her parents left, the accused went to her house around 2 pm and asked her to come to his house to help him in some work. “When she came to his house, he allegedly tried to force himself on the 14-year-old,” a police officer said. As the girl, a Class 9 student, resisted and raised alarm, the accused smashed a glass bottle on her head, covered her mouth with one hand and squeezed her neck with another.</p>
      <p>“As her body became motionless after a while, he realised that she had died. The accused then packed her body in a gunny bag and tied it with a shoelace,” an officer said.</p>
      <p>The accused took her body to Palghar on his bike. After reaching Talasari, the accused allegedly tried to dump the body in a nullah and also made attempts to set it on fire. He later disposed the body on the Mumbai-Gujarat highway at Talasari and left.</p>
      <p>Her parents approached Samta Nagar police station on October 2 and registered a case of kidnapping. Her body was located by Talasari police on October 3, who registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence.</p>
      <p>“We suspected the accused since day one. Whenever we called him to the police station for inquiry, he misguided us,” said an investigator.</p>
      <p>However, on November 16, the investigators got their hands on his second mobile number following which they obtained its call data record, which showed his location at Talasari on the evening of October 1. “We called him to the police station and inquired. We asked him about his location at Talasari on October 1, he broke down and confessed to the crime,” said senior police inspector Raju Kasbe of Samta Nagar police station.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Talasari police conducted postmortem on the girl’s body and collected DNA samples. The accused has been booked under relevant sections of murder, outraging the modesty of a woman and destruction of evidence of the IPC along with sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012.</p>
