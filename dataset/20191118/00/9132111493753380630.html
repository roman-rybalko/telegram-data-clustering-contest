      <p>A 27-year-old trader who allegedly defrauded a midwife of her GH?10,000.00 under the pretext of securing her a building plot at Abuakwa Mim in the Atwima Nwabiagya Municipality, has been remanded into police custody by the Nkawie Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>Kwaku Boakye, the accused, whose plea was not taken, would make his next appearance in the court presided over by Mr Michael Johnson Abbey on November 26, this year.</p>

      <p>She said accused claimed he had a building plot for sale at a value which amounted to GH?10,000.00.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said the complainant agreed to buy the property and after she had been taken to the site to inspect it, she paid the said amount to the accused.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Amankwaa said complainant later visited the said land only to realize that it was being developed by another person who claimed to have bought it from the Chief of Achiase in the Municipality.</p>
