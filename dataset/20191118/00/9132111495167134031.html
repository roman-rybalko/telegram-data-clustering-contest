      <p>Dr Clifford Braimah, the Managing Director of Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), has called on staff of the Company to develop a new mindset that falls in line with the new path of the Company, to ensure success.</p>
      <p>He said the GWCL has set itself on a new trajectory and there is the need for each worker to join hands in concerted efforts to achieve the desired results of not only improving the fortunes of the Company, but also provide sustainable water supply to Ghanaians.</p>
      <p>Addressing the 30th-anniversary celebration of the Ghana Water Company Limited Ladies’ Association in Kumasi, Dr Braimah commended the members for their continued support in revenue mobilization for the Company, and philanthropic gestures towards the marginalized in the society.</p>
      <p>The ceremony was held under the theme: “Inclusiveness in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: Leaving no one behind.”</p>
      <p>He called on the workers to continue to work hard to improve the performance and image of GWCL.</p>
      <p>Mrs Juliana Konama Amponsah-Asiamah, President of the Association, said their objective is to promote the welfare of members and support management to achieve the overall aims and objectives of the Company.</p>
      <p>She said some of the projects embarked on by the Association include the construction of 10 household toilet facilities at Chorkor in Accra, the drilling of two mechanized boreholes at Hwiabaa in the Ahafo Ano North District and the provision of 21 standpipes in Ahwiam in the Tema Metropolis.</p>
      <p>In addition to these, she said, the Association has also adopted Vodzakpo Primary School in the Agortime Kportoe District, under its “you and your community” programme.</p>
      <p>Mrs Amponsah-Asiamah said the Association was not going to be complacent with its achievement, but would continue to work hard to uphold the image of the GWCL whiles maintaining unity and singleness of purpose among members.</p>
      <p>She appealed to management of the GWCL to consider the development of modern offices with the kind of ambience that would be appreciated by their numerous customers.</p>
