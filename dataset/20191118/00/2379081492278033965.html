      <p>TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co Ltd is in talks with big music labels – Universal Music , Sony Music and Warner Music – for global licensing deals to include their songs on its new music subscription service, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.</p>
      <p>ByteDance is looking to launch its music streaming as soon as next month, initially in emerging markets such as India, Indonesia and Brazil, before a future opening in the United States, the FT reported <a href="https://on.ft.com/37brU3U">https://on.ft.com/37brU3U</a>, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>In addition to on-demand music, ByteDance’s app will include a library of short video clips for listeners to search through and synch to songs as they listen, the report added.</p>
      <p>ByteDance has not given a name to its music app yet and pricing remains unclear, although it is expected to cost less than the $10 a month charged by Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc and others in the United States, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The company was not immediately available for comment on Sunday. (Reporting by Anurag Maan in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney)</p>
