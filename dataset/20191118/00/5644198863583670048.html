      <p>PARIS: Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal as reigning champions Portugal secured their place at the Euro 2020 finals on Sunday (Nov 17) with a 2-0 victory away to Luxembourg, while France ended their qualifying campaign with victory.</p>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes struck the opening goal on 39 minutes before Ronaldo tapped in a scrappy second late on to clinch second place in Group B behind winners Ukraine, who drew 2-2 in Serbia.</p>

      <p>Iranian striker Ali Daei holds the world record with 109 international goals scored in 149 appearances between 1993 and 2006.</p>
      <p>"All records must be broken and I will beat that record," said Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>Portugal became the 17th nation to qualify for next year's multi-host tournament, which kicks off in Rome on Jun 12, joining the likes of world champions France, Spain, Italy and England.</p>
      <p>"We can't give the match high marks for style," said Portugal coach Fernando Santos, who admitted the heavy pitch made life challenging for his team.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy for my players because the qualifying campaign has been more difficult than we expected.</p>
      <p>"We're through to the finals of a major tournament for an 11th straight time. You've got to believe in these players."</p>
      <p>Portugal knew they would book their place at Euro 2020 with a win or by matching Serbia's result from their game in Belgrade.</p>
      <p>But they were made to work hard by a Luxembourg team ranked 96th in the world that notably held France to a 0-0 draw in 2018 World Cup qualifying.</p>
      <p>Sporting Lisbon midfielder Fernandes broke the deadlock before half-time, controlling Bernardo Silva's pinpoint pass expertly before lashing in from 20 yards.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, who smacked in a hat-trick in Thursday's 6-0 thrashing of Lithuania, moved to the brink of his international century four minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Silva's far-post cross was forced towards goal by Diogo Jota, with Luxembourg goalkeeper Anthony Moris getting a hand to the ball before Ronaldo turned in from the goalline.</p>

        <b>FRANCE SIGN OFF WITH WIN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Later on Sunday, world champions France wrapped up top spot in Group H as goals from Corentin Tolisso and Antoine Griezmann sealed a 2-0 win over Albania in Tirana.</p>
      <p>"I'm very dependent on the players," French World Cup-winning coach Didier Deschamps said after his 100th game in charge.</p>
      <p>"It's a personal pride. But it's good to see what the players do together. At times, it can be a bit more difficult with changes to the players, injured players, but the spirit is there."</p>
      <p>The French national anthem was roundly booed before kick-off as retribution for the error that saw the Andorran anthem played instead of the Albanian one when the teams met in September at the Stade de France.</p>
      <p>The visitors made a quick start on the pitch, though, as Bayern Munich midfielder Tolisso headed Griezmann's free-kick into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona star slotted in the second himself on the half-hour mark, before the dead rubber petered out in the second period, with Olivier Giroud going closest to a third by striking the post.</p>
      <p>The other games in the group saw Turkey, who had also already sealed qualification, beat Andorra 2-0, while Iceland edged to a 2-1 victory at Moldova.</p>
      <p>England rounded off an impressive campaign with a 4-0 thrashing of Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Goals from Harry Winks, Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount ensured England finished at the Group A summit, having scored 37 goals in just eight matches.</p>
      <p>"We know there is still a bit of work to do but I can't fault the players in this campaign, they've been ruthless. We're more settled with the group now," said England manager Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <p>The Czech Republic are also through, but lost 1-0 in Bulgaria on Sunday.</p>
