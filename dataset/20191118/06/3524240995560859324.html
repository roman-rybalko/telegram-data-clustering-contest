      <p>A quinquagenarian, Gbenga Oposanwo, has died after 54-year-old Segun Mopoderun allegedly poured hot water on him during an argument in the Ogba-Aguda area of Agege, Lagos State.</p>
      <p><i>PUNCH Metro</i> gathered that after the attack, the 58-year-old Oposanwo was rushed to hospital for treatment where he later died and his corpse was deposited in the mortuary.</p>
      <p>The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said in a statement on Sunday that homicide detectives from the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department had arrested Mopoderun, adding that he would be charged.</p>
      <p>Elkana stated, “On Saturday, November 16, 2019, around 6.30 p.m., one Segun Mopoderun, 54, of No. 3 Iyanu Oluwopo Street, off County Road, Ogba-Aguda, Agege, Lagos State, allegedly poured hot water on one Gbenga Oposanwo, 58, of the same address, during an altercation between them.</p>
      <p>“The victim was rushed to hospital for treatment, where he later died. The corpse has been deposited in the Ikorodu General Hospital mortuary for autopsy. The suspect has been arrested by homicide detectives from the SCIID, Panti, Yaba. An investigation is ongoing; the suspect will be charged.”</p>
      <p>In another development, a yet-to-be-identified painter was crushed to death by a driver, Meshach Baba, under the Masha overhead bridge in the Surulere area of the state.</p>
      <p>It was learnt that Meshach was driving a Toyota Camry with number plate Lagos BDG 24 FL on top speed when he suddenly veered off into another lane, crashing into a motorcyclist and his passenger in the process.</p>
      <p>Meshach also rammed two other vehicles coming from the Shitta area of Surulere.</p>
      <p>According to Elkana, the yet-to-be-identified passenger, who might be a painter, died on the spot, but the motorcyclist survived the crash.</p>
      <p>The PPRO, who confirmed the accident in a statement, said the driver had been arrested and would be charged, while the remains of the painter had been deposited in a mortuary.</p>
      <p>Elkana stated, “On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, around 12.30pm, a case of a fatal motor accident involving three Toyota cars and a motorcycle at the Masha overhead bridge was reported at the Surulere Police Station. A driver of a black Toyota Camry with number plate Lagos BDG 24 FL, Meshach Baba, of No. 10 Odogbolu Street, off Ademola Aguda, Lagos State, was driving from the National Stadium on top speed towards the Masha area, when he swerved into another lane and hit a Bajaj motorcycle with a rider and his passenger, and also hit two vehicles that were equally coming from Shitta towards the National Stadium.</p>
      <p>“The passenger on the motorcycle died on the spot. The name and address of the passenger are not known yet, but indication showed that he might be a painter, because his clothes were stained with different colours of paint.</p>
      <p>“The corpse has been deposited in the Randle General Hospital mortuary in Surulere. The damaged vehicles were removed from the road for VIO inspection, while the driver, who caused the accident, has been arrested. An investigation is ongoing and the suspect will be charged.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, two suspected traffic robbers, Sylvester Uzo and Azeez Ibrahim, have been arrested for allegedly stealing a phone belonging to one Femi Omojolowo on the Community Road in the Bariga area of the state.</p>
      <p>Elkana said operatives from the Bariga Police Division, who acted on a tip-off, arrested the suspects, who had confessed to the crime.</p>
      <p>He added that the suspects would be charged.</p>
      <p>The PPRO said, “On Sunday, November 10, 2019, around 11.30pm, acting on a tip-off, operatives of the Bariga Police Station arrested one Sylvester Uzor, 23, of No. 128 Moradeyo Street, Agboju, Lagos State, and his accomplice, Azeez Ibrahim, 23, of No. 16 Jane Onifade Street, Iyana-Ipaja, with a black iPhone 7plus.</p>
