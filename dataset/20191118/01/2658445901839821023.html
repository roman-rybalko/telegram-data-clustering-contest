      <p>IT is ironic that the 38th Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) International Convention, held at the Institute of Management Technology (IMT), Enugu, from October 31 to November 3, ended in a fiasco. Writers are expected to be civilized, but the problem at the conference was civilizational. The theme of the convention was Literature, Nationalism and the Poetics of Integration. In the end, the event showed politics of disintegration. Indeed, the ANA may well be on its way out.</p>
      <p>A new ANA National President was supposed to be elected at the convention. There were four contenders: Camilus Uka, Ahmed Maiwada, Ofonime Inyang and Chike Ofili.</p>
      <p>A disturbing report by Evelyn Osagie of The Nation captured the development that showed the ANA’s underdevelopment: “Saturday, November 2, was characterised by political feuds and theatrics that culminated in the cancellation of the election allegedly on the grounds of “faulty” electoral process. The tension was heightened when the outgoing executive, led by Mallam Denja Abdullahi, was said to have allegedly brought in “soldier boys” and other security operatives to the venue, perhaps to monitor elections, amid counter allegations of money changing hands, among other malpractices.”</p>
      <p>“Aggrieved delegates not only raised the alarm over the move, they also faulted the electoral process. As a result, a new electoral panel was constituted with Prof. Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo as chairman. Mr. Ofeimun, a former ANA president, Prof. Remi Raji, Diego Okenyodo and chairman of Lagos ANA branch Yemi Adebiyi as members.”</p>
      <p>“All hell broke loose when displeased delegates, especially from Akwa Ibom branch, were further aggravated by discrepancies in the list of delegates qualified to vote. This led to a swarm of writers protesting, calling for the cancellation of the election.”</p>
      <p>“Fearing that violence might arise, the leadership of IMT, venue of the meeting, ordered that they vacate the hall.”</p>
      <p>“And since decisions could not be reached on how to conduct the election, after a long deliberation that ran into the night between Adimora-Ezeigbo-led panel and the 25 ANA branch chairmen, Raji addressed delegates in line with the association’s constitution, saying: “After deliberation between the five-man panel led by Prof Adimora-Ezeigbo and the 25 ANA branch chairmen, it was agreed that election is postponed, and would hold within the next 180 days as enshrined in the ANA constitution. The place or state where it would be held would be communicated to us through the chairmen of the state branches.”</p>
      <p>As things stand, the ANA is without a substantive leader for the first time in its history. It is ironic that the fiasco happened in the same city where the association had held the maiden edition of its yearly convention 38 years ago, when the association was established by literary luminary Chinua Achebe, and others.</p>
      <p>The outgoing ANA National President Denja Abdullahi was quoted as saying:  “ANA is an association of intellectuals. Anyone vying for any leadership position must do so with a mind to serve. Leadership is not a do-or-die affair. We know of those who paid for people’s accommodation and were sharing money. Why? What for? It is indeed unfortunate.”</p>
      <p>It looks like writers have become politicians, and politicians have become writers. Abdullahi’s allegations would have sounded normal if they were about Nigeria’s politicians and political environment. But he was talking about writers, who are supposed to reflect high-mindedness.</p>
      <p>According to the report, “Many, however, observed that the battle was not about who led the association but a war over ANA land at Mpape, Abuja.”  The late Gen Mamman Vatsa gave 60.9 hectares to the association in 1985. Abdullahi said in an October 2018 interview: “The government that gave the land in the first place which was at 60.9 hectares cut it into about 57 hectares and when the present developer took possession in 2012 and went to the Abuja land authorities to verify documents and papers discovered that the size of the land has been further reduced to 36.9 hectares.”</p>
      <p>He added: “On the land presently we have burgeoning structures that will later translate into a conference centre, library, shopping malls, offices, auditorium, writers’ residency chalets, 50- one bedroom en-suite apartments for rent and all other structures. The national secretariat of the Association has been moved since March this year from the National Theatre in Lagos to a completed red-brick structure on the land that now houses it.”</p>
      <p>One of those who want to lead the association, Ahmed Maiwada, a lawyer, poet and novelist, however, said in an interview this month:  “We must know who got the missing portions of land and how the land got out in the first place.” He also said: “I want to correct the impression that the 36.9 hectares of the ANA was salvaged by ANA legal team; it is a lie. I achieved that feat alone. If any other lawyer was there when I won the case in 2012, let him come out and say so. I was the Legal Adviser for ANA and I was the ANA lawyer for the case, too, and I was the only one going to court.”</p>
      <p>According to Maiwada, “When I finished that case, I recovered 36.9 hectares. The value of that 36.9 hectares, as at 2012 when I recovered it, was 1.2 billion naira, according to KNVR, the new developer. After seeing that, I made a token request of 15 million naira only as my payment (it was supposed to be 10 percent on the value of the recovered land), because I was also a member of ANA, and didn’t want to charge more than that. Unknown to me, the ANA authorities then had requested for 20 million naira from the developer to pay me, and got it, yet I did not get a kobo. They should have kept, at least, 5 million naira and pay me my 15 million naira; but they didn’t. The developer was not supposed to give them a kobo, for that was not part of the agreement we signed with the developer. But he still gave them. These people blew the money.”</p>
      <p>“The current ANA president would tell you the association paid me 5 million naira. How did I get that 5 million naira? There was a second case I was doing for ANA -I did about four cases for the association in all -and I declared a strike on the condition that the initial 15 million naira must be paid. That was when I heard the money had been paid. The developer had already sunk in money, and my success or failure in that case would affect him, so he promised to pay me. He, then, gave 5 million naira to ANA. That was how I got that 5 million naira. I told them that 5 million naira was only meant for the second case. Up till now, ANA hasn’t paid me the 15 million naira.”</p>
      <p>The ANA’s mess is a bad story. It is a continuing story that is likely to get messier.</p>
