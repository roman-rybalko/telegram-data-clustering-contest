      <p>After two successive trading sessions on positive sentiment, the Nigerian Stock Exchange on Wednesday lost N57 billion due to sell pressure on 15 stocks.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the market capitalisation lost N56 billion to close at N12.822 trillion from the N12.878 trillion achieved on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said that “As sentiment still remains weak toward the stock market, we maintain our bearish outlook in the absence of catalysts to spur investors’ appetite for equities”.</p>

      <p>Ikeja Hotels recorded the highest price appreciation of 9.09 per cent to close at 96k per share.</p>

      <p>This was in contrast to the turnover of 378.35 million shares valued at N7.15 billion achieved in 4,798 deals on Tuesday.</p>
