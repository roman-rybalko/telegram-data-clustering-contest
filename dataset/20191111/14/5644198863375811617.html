      <p>MUMBAI: India's search for a limited-overs No 4 batsman may finally be at an end after Shreyas Iyer proved his worth with a maiden Twenty20 international fifty in Sunday's series decider against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>India's struggles to fill the batting spot dominated the headlines in the lead-up to this year's 50-over World Cup in England, where they went out in the semi-finals to New Zealand.</p>

      <p>It has been the same in the T20 format with a number of candidates fluffing their auditions in the buildup to the World Cup and Iyer was promoted to the spot for the three-match series against Bangladesh having previously batted a spot lower.</p>
      <p>After impressive cameos in the first two matches at Delhi and Rajkot, the 24-year-old Mumbai batsman smashed 62 off just 33 balls in India's series-clinching win at Nagpur.</p>
      <p>"Obviously there is lot of competition currently going on in the team," Iyer told reporters. "I personally feel that I compete with myself. I don't want myself to be judged with anyone or when you say that this position is empty in the team.</p>
      <p>"I am really open-minded and can bat at any number at a given point."</p>
      <p>With the experienced partnership of Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan locked in as openers and captain and batting talisman Virat Kohli coming in at first drop, India have a top order to rival any in the game.</p>
      <p>Iyer scored a couple of half-centuries in the 50-overs format in the West Indies and showed plenty of positive intent against Bangladesh to suggest he could be the long-term answer at the spot with the T20 World Cup in Australia less than a year away.</p>
      <p>"It has been a really important last few series for me to set up the benchmark at the No 4 position, which all of us are competing for at the moment," said Iyer, who leads the Delhi franchise in the Indian Premier League T20 tournament.</p>
      <p>"For me personally, they (team management) have given me a heads up that, 'You'll be there at No 4 so just back yourself and really believe in yourself'.</p>
      <p>"We need someone even when Kohli and Rohit get out to finish the game and bat till the end. That role is of a No 4."</p>
