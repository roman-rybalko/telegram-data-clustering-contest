        <i>Abdul Oroh, former House of Representatives member, served as Commissioner for Information, and later, Agriculture in Edo State. He spoke with Deputy Editor (Daily) <b>EMMANUEL OLADESU</b> in Lagos on the rift between Governor Godwin Obaseki and All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the crisis in the House of Assembly and why reconciliation has been futile.</i>

      <p>
        <b>In whose interest is the protracted crisis in the Edo State APC?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is not in the interest of anybody. Definitely not in the interest of the party. Not in the interest of Edo State. And certainly not in the interest of even the governor. He is the governor. He is supposed to bring everybody together to pursue good governance, to pursue the objective that the people had in mind when they voted for him. That is to pursue development; to give people leadership, to sustain the developmental process that was started by his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole.</p>
      <p>It is in the interest of the governor, to at the end of his tenure, be able to tell the people his achievements. Achievement is not just about tangible things, infrastructure. But, what about the peace of that society? What of social harmony? What of unity? Now, he has scattered the party, or he is trying to scatter the party. In Edo State, few days ago while the governor was in Lagos, a federal high court judge was kidnapped. The orderly was killed. A week or two ago, another high court judge was kidnapped. People are being attacked in their homes by thugs. Kidnappings everywhere. If it rains once, the whole of Benin is flooded, despite the monumental amount of money poured into de-flooding. Of course, the project has been abandoned.  So, he has not been able to embrace people. He is repulsed by the presence of the people that elected him. He doesn’t reach out; he doesn’t engage people. He has contempt for people. Apparently, he was not psychologically prepared for governance. He may claim to be an economist, a banker. But, it is now we are really having the opportunity to scrutinize him. From what we are saying, a dummy was sold to us. He was portrayed as an intellectual, a technocrat. But, no technocrat will allow people to be attacked in their homes. Thugs were attacking party meetings. A former governor who is the national chairman of the party, someone who handpicked him and presented him to the party and he was elected, who campaigned for him everywhere, was attacked by thugs in his house. There was another meeting in Ikwuebe. Thugs dispersed them. Then, on a Sunday, it was my turn in my Ivbiro. So, what legacy does he want to bequeath? If he wants to be reelected, what is he going to tell the people that he has achieved? What has he done for them that will make it necessary for them to reelect him; that will convince the people to really support him?</p>
      <p>
        <b>At what stage did the governor start to part ways with his leader, Oshiomhole?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before he was elected, there were a lot of red flags. Those who actually knew this guy told the former governor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, that he should have a rethink. Traditional rulers, former school mates, former professional colleagues, even members of his own family and those of us who worked closely with him when he was the chairman of the so-called economic team; a one-man team, were cautious. I spoke with the former governor about my impression of the guy. Oshiomhole meant well. He wanted somebody who knew what he was doing, who had been part of the process, who quote and unquote was an economist, that would take process forward, that would sustain the developmental process that we started; a person that would continue the projects we had on ground.</p>
      <p>The first two years of his administration, everybody gave him the benefit of doubt. The central hospital in Benin was built in 1903. When we came in, we could see the roof. There was not a single working x-ray machine. Doctors were bringing equipment to test patients from home. They were personal property. Then, Oshiomhole decided to build a five star hospital. I remember the foundation ceremony was done a few days after the funeral of his wife, Clara Oshiomhole. He was still mourning. He felt, may be, if we had a good health facility, his wife wouldn’t have died. He built the hospital and he built another one in his wife’s community. Two years after the hospital was commissioned by President Buhari, it was still under lock and key. The New Era College, which was modernised and equipped with infrastructure, and renamed after Ogbemudia; the Samuel Ogbemudia College, was under lock and key. The Benin Anti-Flood Project was abandoned for two years. Multi-billion naira project. Then, even, the agricultural project. He said government does not do agriculture. So, let’s us bring investors. But, he is bringing vendors to Edo State who are selling rice seeds. All the major agric companies that came to Edo State, that applied for lands, 12 companies were given C of O. After we left office, nothing was heard again. By now, as we are hearing about Kebbi rice, we should be hearing about Edo rice. A whole lot of things would have been happening now.</p>
      <p>When he started, we saw him renovating the Edo State Secretariat, which was abandoned. And he was rebuilding the High Court Complex. He was renovating structures in Government House. But, what about the schools? We started the ‘red roof’ revolution to rebuild all the secondary schools in Edo State, primary schools, equip them with basic things, chairs and tables; a clean environment conducive for learning. We were set for the process of retraining teachers, screening those that we had to fish out those that were not competent. The Prof. Agbolahoan Committee was set up. The successor was to take the process forward. The professor is the former vice chancellor of Ambrose Ali University. Then, apart from frustrating the basic education, he went on to close the colleges of agriculture. He closed the one in Agenebode. He closed the one that was renamed Tayo Akpata University. You can do reforms while the institutions are still running. You can change staffing, bringing new people to man them. That is the present situation of all those institutions. He said he was laying the foundation of a college of agriculture, an institution that was established either by Ambrose Ali or Ogbemudia.</p>
      <p>He started the process of political exclusion. People were no longer allowed to even enter Government House. You can’t get close to him. He was not tolerating or engaging anybody. When Oshiomhole was governor, he proposed that we should sell the Lagos House in Victoria Island and he wanted to use the money to build an international conference centre opposite the airport. The building there was relocated to Ekwen Palace. There was protest by Edo people. The former governor called a meeting at Idia College. All the traditional rulers were called. They gave him a go ahead. But, because he was not still satisfied, he held series of township meetings. Because he was not satisfied, he had to abandon the project. Although he was not making money from the Edo House, he had to leave it. We were paying heavy taxes on it. Those who rented it owed three years’ rent. Oshiomhole did a lot of consultation. Even, the taxes proposed to raise the IGR, he took it to the street. We held several town hall meetings. He held zonal meetings.</p>
      <p>You hold conferences. You bring all the speakers from Lagos and other places. You pay them for coming to present papers. These people may not know what is happening in Edo State. In one of those conferences, the one for agriculture, I went there. I flew to Benin from Abuja. They refused to register me. They said I was not invited. You don’t ever get results from those conferences. He has been in pursuit of elusive investors. How can investors come to a place where cultists and thugs are on rampage, where there is kidnapping. If you are an investor, would you go there? It took the public protest by civil society before he could come up with a solution to the Central Hospital in Edo. What we heard was that he had privatised it. Who did you consult before you privatized it? How can an ordinary Edo person has access to the hospital? If you privatize it, it will be driven by public motive. It will no longer do the social service that hospital is expected to do.</p>

        <b>The governor said he has come to manage resources well, unlike those who had wasted the resources…</b>
      </p>
      <p>He has come to manage resources well by chartering a jet almost twice a week. He virtually lives in Abuja. When he came to Lagos yesterday, how did he come? He chartered an air craft. Do you know what it costs to charter a plane?  To travel out of Benin. Not to talk of flying to China. China is like his second home. He has signed many MoUs that people have lost count. They call him MoU governor. There is no accountability at all. You see projects going on. You don’t know when they were advertised. The process of awarding contracts are not followed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The governor said Oshiomhole hired touts for revenue collection…</b>
      </p>
      <p>Governor Obaseki was the chairman of the Committee on IGR under Oshiomhole. Governor Obaseki was a member of the Inland Revenue Service. Every week, he would preside over the meeting of the Bord of Inland Revenue. He would report to exco every Monday morning. All commissioners were invited to present the performance of every ministry. So, how can he now say that? It was public/private partnership. It was happening in Lagos. He brought it to Edo State. He would say let’s do it the way Lagos was doing it. He was the chairman and he would report how much were raised. If there were problems, he would raise them. I will show you a tape where he was praising the people he now call thugs during his campaigns. He was praising them during his campaigns for doing a wonderful job. He said he was going to carry them along and empower them. That was the group led by Tony Kabaka. It was called Koras Ventures. He had a group of boys working for him. They were collecting revenue for government. It is possible that they didn’t meet his own expectation. But, if you are not going to use them, fine. Call them and tell them how you are going to empower them. It is not by putting them in prisons and demolishing their houses, threatening their families, arresting them and humiliating them. Almost those identified as his opponents have been given land use charge running into millions.  My house in Benin, where I used to pay N26,000, I was given N314,000. Now, I know that the guy who was elected in my own local government has not been sworn till today. They have targeted people for persecution. Is that how to govern?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why is the Oshiomhole camp insisting on another proclamation for the House of Assembly?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is not Oshiomhole that is insisting.</p>
      <p>That is the right thing to do. That is what the National Assembly has directed. A proclamation is not what you do in secret. Was it announced in Edo Broadcasting Service? Was it published in The Nigerian Observer? Was it published by any newspaper in Edo State? Was it aired on any television station? It was seven days after the end of tenure. All the Houses of Assembly in Nigeria had been proclaimed. The members-elect came to Benin and held a press conference that the governor should issue a proclamation. That night, some of them were invited to the Government House and taken at gun point to the Edo State House of Assembly to be inaugurated. Some of them said no. They went to hold a meeting. They were dispersed by thugs. They were thoroughly beaten. When the National Assembly members visited him, they showed him President Muhammadu Buhari’s proclamation and a letter of invitation from the Clerk of National Assembly telling them the date and time of the inauguration, and cards for two or three members of their families.</p>
      <p>
        <b>APC is divided in Edo State. Is reconciliation possible?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reconciliation is possible, if the governor can humble himself, embrace stakeholders instead of intimidating, vilifying them, attacking them with thugs. He should embrace all the members-elect and withdraw the cases. He has been going to the PDP for endorsement. His strategy is to weaken the APC and cross to another party. If he wants reconciliation, he knows what to do. He can start with the House of Assembly, rectify the errors he has made and embrace them.</p>
