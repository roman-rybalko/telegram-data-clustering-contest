      <p>Coconut is a complete food rich in calories, vitamins and minerals. Although, its meat is excessively high in saturated fats in comparison to other common edible nuts, coconut has many health promoting bioactive compounds. It contains lauric acid which increases good high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in the blood. HDL has beneficial effects on the coronary arteries by preventing vessel blockage (atherosclerosis).</p>
      <p>Coconut water is packed with simple sugar, electrolysis, minerals and bioactive compounds. Although, these enzymes aid digestion and metabolism. A particular research study shows that cytokine (small secreted proteins released by cells) in coconut water showed significant anti-ageing, anti-carcinogenic and anti-thrombotic properties. The kernel is an excellent source of minerals such as copper, calcium, iron, manganese, magnesiumvand zinc. It is also a very good source of B-complex vitamins such as foliates riboflavin, niacin, thiamine and pyridoxine. These vitamins are essential in the sense that the body requires them for external sources. Coconut meat and water contain a good amount of potassium.</p>
      <p>Coconut contains a high amount of saturated fats but these could be harmless depending on the person’s health (not mostly recommended for someone who is obese), they contain medium chain medium chain triglycerides which are fatty acids of medium length. These fatty acids are absorbed differently by the body. They go straight to the liver from the digestive system, they are further turned into ketone bodies, which can have therapeutic effects on brain disorders like epilepsy and Alzheimer’s. Other health benefits of coconut include the following.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>1. Fibre content: Coconut is rich in dietary fibre. Its fibre slows down the release of glucose then transports it to the cell where it will be converted into energy.</p>
