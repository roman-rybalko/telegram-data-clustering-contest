      <p>As long as government officials or anyone in any position of authority get away without being penalised one way or the other for their misdeeds, we will continue to have such persons take the people they are supposed to serve or be responsible to for granted.</p>
      <p>If the plea by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam El-Rufai, last Thursday, for the re-election of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State is heeded by the people of the state and he gets a second term, the governor would not have learnt the hard lesson for his four years of misrule of the state.</p>
      <p>Perhaps because he became governor by default due to the death of Audu Abubakar, Bello did everything but provided good governance for the people of the state. How can he justify owing civil servants in the state so much and the reign of terror during his first term and yet expect to be rewarded with re-election?</p>
      <p>Chances are that by the time this article is published, Bello would have been re-elected considering his hold on the state and the funds available to him, including the one hurriedly approved for him by the Senate, thanks to President Muhammadu Buhari. He will go down in history as one young man who had the opportunity of improving the lots of his people but failed woefully.</p>
      <p>What governors and other political office holders owe their people is, among others, good governance to improve their standard of living, but, unfortunately, most of them behave the way they like with the least regard for the electorate forgetting that they will still need their votes for the second term.</p>
      <p>Instead of prioritising the resources available to them, many governors embark on projects that will not benefit a majority of their people. Across the country, there are many abandoned projects which should not have been embarked on if the former governors and even serving ones cared about the good of all.</p>
      <p>Despite claiming not to have enough resources, many political office holders live large at the expense of the people. State resources are converted to private use without caring about the consequences of such criminal acts.</p>
      <p>While some of the carefree politicians fail to get re-elected or have the candidates they support elected, many sadly still get elected or appointed into other positions. Except persons who violate their oath of office are not only stopped from getting re-elected like Bello, but subjected to investigation and made to pay dearly for their actions, our politicians will not believe they need to live to expectations of the people.</p>

      <p>Many former governors currently in the Senate and some before them should not have been elected as their records of performance in their states do not show that they cared much about the people they claim they are still representing. Some who are also ministers did enough damage in their states that they should not have been rewarded with another political appointment.</p>
      <p>Having been governors for eight years in some instances, why must they want continue to be in government and not give others the opportunity to serve the people the way they deserve?</p>
      <p>Voters need to be weary of being deceived by the kind of last-minute plea by El-Rufai for politicians like Bello and ensure that they don’t vote based on any kind of inducements that will always return failed office holders back to office.</p>
