      <p>It seems that Nigeria’s government leaders are getting worried about the effects of the social media more than their political counterparts in many of the countries that had contributed to the creation of this object of culture and communication. Our leaders, like our citizens, need to realise that this communication technology is not the first of human creations that are capable of good and evil.</p>
      <p>The nuclear device is perhaps the most illustrative of the capacity of technology to create goods capable of being positive and negative. The nuclear fusion can provide electricity; it can also in the form of a bomb wipe out mankind. However, government leaders are right to feel uncomfortable about social media, just as their counterparts in Europe, North America, China and Russia are complaining about this source of culture propagation and reproduction. But, like the owners of this technology, political leaders in the third world ought to pay more attention to how to negotiate the use of this technology, rather than to over react to the unlimited access the technology provides for those referred to as citizen journalists, i.e. writers without any training in the journalistic ethics and social responsibility of journalists.</p>
      <p>Overreaction to the a-causal character of social media that allows both rulers and citizens to present their own narratives on their own terms  can be counterproductive to the point of creating laws that can destroy the foundation of the country’s democracy, and, perhaps, the values that have sustained the country’s multiethnic federation. Political leaders ought to be reminded that citizens and communities in the country hold on to the country because they have reasons to believe that they can realise their dreams in a federation of many cultures. And the most important factor in a multicultural space is freedom of expression within the framework of laws to protect the freedom of all citizens.</p>
      <p>Just as the existence of modern communication technologies had encouraged American politicians to interrogate Facebook over interference of fake messages in the country’s politics, Nigeria’s political leaders have a right to worry about the facilitation of fake news and of the spread of hate speech via the social media. But, just like leaders in other democracies, leaders in Nigeria ought not to act with the zeal of a believer in the dictum that the best way to cure headache is to cut the aching head. Members of the executive and the legislature need to accept that the best way to cure headache is to shop for the most effective and least invasive medication for the ailment.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the rush to create a new law to punish propagation of fake news and hate speech seems like an overreaction.  For example, there is nothing in the bill of Senator Abdullahi in respect of hate speech that is not covered in the Cybercrime Act of 2015, which, among other prohibitions, outlaws “Cyber-stalking and Cyber-bullying and prescribes punishment ranging from a fine of not less than N2 million or imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or to both fine and imprisonment, up to a term of not less than 10 years or a fine of not less than N25 million or to both fine and imprisonment; forbids the distribution of racist and xenophobic material to the public through a computer system or network (e.g. Facebook and Twitter); and prohibits the use of threats of violence and insulting statements to persons, based on race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Persons found guilty of this are liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than five years or to a fine of not less thanN10million or to both fine and imprisonment.”</p>
      <p>It is significant that none of the countries with considerable input into the creation of the social media had gone further than Nigeria’s efforts to regulate the social media and discourage hate speech via the media. Undoubtedly, with the Cybercrime Act 2015, Nigeria has already made strong efforts to regulate abuse of social media. Thus, additional attempts at the instance of the executive or the legislature on regulating social media and citizens’ peddling of hate speech seem superfluous and may be seen to the average citizen as needless distraction.</p>
      <p>If there is any difference between the Cybercrime Act of 2015 and the 2019 bills on hate speech, it may be the call for another bureaucracy, Hate Speech Commission. How can a commission prevent hate speech better than the existing law enforcement and judicial systems?  What the government’s fervor about new laws and commissions to punish and prevent hate speech signals is hysteria. The existing Cybercrime law which is designed to do what the new bill in the Senate seeks to do, has been in effect for four years without any special commission to enforce it, other than existing law enforcement and judicial systems.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, our country has entered an era of sharp ideological division, in addition to fault lines embedded in ethnic, cultural, religious differences. The ideological division is not about political parties but about widening differences between worldviews. Many communities and citizens seem to view government as the institution to socialize citizens to love their neighbours rather than abuse or hate them through the power of examples from people in government. Then there are many others that want to coerce people to do so. It is the duty of government in a multicultural state to listen more to the former than it has done. Leaders who recognized socialisation as a more effective mechanism for uniting people of diverse cultures created the National Orientation Agency several years ago.  Apart from the laws already in existence to discourage hate speech and abuse of social media under the rubric of Cybercrime Act, the government ought to further strengthen the National Orientation Agency to embark more robustly on socialising citizens about the superiority of love to hate in a diverse society. The country seems to be experiencing repressed ideological and cultural conflicts that can benefit from liberal governance that prefers to err on the part of freedom than unfreedom.</p>
      <p>The establishment of the Cybercrime Act indicates that members of the Nigerian media do not subscribe to freedom without responsibility. To insist on creating another set of laws on the same matter is a distraction that the country can avoid. Lawmakers and ministers enthusiastic about creating additional laws should take the advice of the Minister of State for Transportation to read or re-read the Cybercrime Act. Nothing heats the polity and scares citizens more than incessant crying wolf. Most of the security problems in the country: banditry, kidnapping, herdsmen/farmers conflicts can benefit from the attention currently going to airing of hate speech via social media, a problem that has already been given a strong legal attention by the Cybercrime Act 2015.</p>
