      <p>First and foremost, what’s happening? Who are those eager to propel President Buhari’s name onto the negative side of history despite his best efforts at righting several wrongs in the country, even if he were to succeed only in finally, and effectively, clubbing corruption, our number one problem, to submission? Who are these people fighting battles Buhari most probably didn’t send them? Who are these enemies of freedom of speech and of association, two fundamental freedoms all over the world, that Nigerians must now have to go to court to protect theirs?</p>
      <p>Why this near total disdain for court decisions which, of course, did not start today in this administration but with the long running Col Dasuki case? And can Omoyele Sowore singly topple this government? How many battalions has the Pope got?</p>
      <p>How come Lai Mohammed now waxes lyrical, ever eager to circumscribe free speech? Has he forgotten, so soon, the amount of scurrility he threw at President  Goodluck Jonathan, half of which, not even Femi Fani Kayode has managed against  President Buhari? Yoruba bo nwon ni ti a ba ran ni nise eru, a fi tomo je – meaning of  course, that if  you’re sent to deliver a slavish message,  you do  it like a free born. Mokan mokan  loye nkan o.</p>
      <p>Is the current, totally needless and anachronistic exertions of the National Assembly, feverishly trying to pass a law regulating the social media, and, another, prescribing the death penalty – in this day and age – for a nebulous hate speech, the way to show you are cooperating with the executive branch?</p>
      <p>Why are some people so eager to take us back to the  Abacha  days minus,  of course, its state sponsored assassinations? How come the Army, and even Customs,  now unilaterally give directives they have no constitutional powers to give as in the court – halted identification exercise and the order banning sale of petroleum products 20 kilometres to the border?</p>
      <p>What is afoot? Why this creeping totalitarianism? No matter how crafted, a Hate Speech Law,  in the year of our Lord two thousand and nineteen, would be, to use PDP’s words, “savage, repressive, cruel and murderous”. To imagine that the bill even proposes a death penalty – where, for God’s sake,  are the  David Mark’s and the Sola Adeyeye’s of yore?</p>
      <p>I digress.</p>
      <p>By far the most litigious group in Nigeria today must be the  politicians who head to court in droves every election cycle, as if  they must – the reason INEC  is currently battling with about 1600 court cases according to its chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu. This he disclosed at an interaction with the Senate committee on INEC.  Asked how the commission funds these cases, the chairman said that the commission makes budgetary provisions, based on projections of cases adding that the number of in-house lawyers handling them are now completely inadequate. The above should give Nigerians  an idea of  what  huge  amount  of money goes into this meaningless  legal extravaganza that benefits only individuals.</p>
      <p>Consider for instance, the Atiku/PDP case against the election of President Muhammadu Buhari about which the Supreme Court recently made the final pronouncement. While Atiku going to the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal was logical,  progressing beyond it  was absolutely ill -thought  of , given the incurable issues that emerged from the tribunal – legal facts that made a complete nonsense of the case going beyond the tribunal stage, as even a non lawyer should see, ahead, the futility of such an effort. For instance, isn’t it forlorn to call only five polling agents as witnesses from  the 191,000 polling units where the law prescribes that for a petition to succeed, the appellant must present a polling agent from each of the polling units across the country to testify? The interesting case of the so-called INEC server is another. How a prosecution counsel could wish  to validate the most important part of his case, upon which  depended  the fate of  the entire case, by relying on a witness who would, at best , be described as a hack, must reckon as the joke of the century.</p>
      <p>According to the PDP candidate that ‘server’ had given him victory over Buhari by allotting to him a total of 18,356,732, against Buhari’s 16,741,430  but when he was to provide  irrefutable  evidence for that salacious claim, he did no better than present a witness  – David Ayu Nyango Njoga, an uncertified I.T ‘expert’ from Kenya, assisted by a   poor Osita Chidoka, both of who failed miserably to prove anything; the reason the Supreme court threw off that leg of the case by holding “that the  manual provided by INEC made no room for electronic transmission of results, and that  for that to happen, the Electoral Act must be amended to that effect”.</p>
      <p>Nor was that all.</p>
      <p>The   issue of   President Buhari’s qualification was another leg of the  case which  no serious prosecution counsel should have pursued further  after the  tribunal has held that: “ Mr Buhari is not only qualified, he is eminently qualified to contest the election  because  ”  the evidence tendered  regarding Buhari’s qualifications  could not  be relied upon, since the PDP did not issue or make the certificate, nor was a   ”candidate  required ,  under the Electoral Act  , to attach his certificate to his form CF001…”</p>
      <p>Why  in the face of all these  incurable defects did the litigants still choose  to go to  the Supreme court?  Were there a higher court, Atiku would obviously still be in court , no matter how obvious these lacunae. As the multi- award winning Chairman of The Nation’s Editorial Board, Sam Omatseye,  puts it in ATIKU’S REQUIEM: “ …t hey hope, in their fantasy, that they could court the heavens and so God is made flesh, wrestles like Jacob and upturns the ruling. Not even the assertion that the Supreme Court is infallible because it is final is any consolation”.</p>
      <p>In trying to answer the   question,   as to what motivates the politician’s eagerness to always head to court,  it  is conceded  that  Atiku, as  one of Nigerians richest  politicians , if not by far the richest, does not exactly fit into the class of those whose primary focus is  to share in the stupendous loot  our politics offers, especially at the National Assembly where,  no thanks to  former President  Obasanjo’s  inflicted  successors, whose  personal  weaknesses t he National Assembly members exploited to become totally unconscionable, awarding themselves perquisites that were   far and  above   what   the Revenue Mobilisation, Fiscal and Allocation Commission   approved for them, and took   whatever salaries and allowances caught their fancy .</p>
      <p>To understand Atiku’s motive,  therefore, we may have to press former President Obasanjo into service as he generously answered this question in his book, : My Watch , wherein he wrote:  (slightly edited): “What I did not know, which came out glaringly later …was his propensity for poor judgment, his belief and reliance on marabouts , his trust in money to buy his way out on all issues and his readiness to sacrifice national interest for self and selfish interest”.</p>
      <p>Shall we just say then that his motivation was simply power. Being already so rich, Alhaji Atiku Abubkar  wanted power.</p>
      <p>While we would have to leave the former vice president to ponder these obviously harsh words from a man he remains ,  like forever,  beholden to, we must,  as a nation, do something about the sinking hole our politics has become, and forcefully  rein in a National Assembly whose membership  has become so attractive  former governors, most of who ruined their respective states now rush to,  increasingly turning it to a sinecure position. Since the Revenue Mobilisation Commission has become so prostrate it no longer serves the national interest – witness also its inability to come up with a new revenue sharing formula  in over a decade,  Nigerians must put heads together to untie  the inscrutable nut the National Assembly has become ,  gulping annually, a minimum of N125B almost for   doing   nothing.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested, for instance, and in respected quarters too, that we do away with the senate. While that is a proposition that may take time to eventuate, I think concrete steps must be taken to rescue Nigeria from the stranglehold of a mere 469 citizens.</p>
      <p>But  the rapacity does not stop there,</p>
      <p>It is the craze for loot that makes politicians think nothing of what becomes of their political party even where they had held high positions like governors, legislators, ministers etc . This is what has decimated the APC in places like Zamfara, Rivers and is presently manifesting in Bayelsa State.  Many more may actually be in the offing in places like Edo and Ondo states – two states where elections are at hand, and where politicians are, traditionally, in the habit of fighting to the death.</p>
      <p>The essence of this piece, therefore, is that what motivates most of our politicians is not service to the people but loot and unless Nigerians move to sanitise this ugly situation, we would, continually, be under their stranglehold.</p>
