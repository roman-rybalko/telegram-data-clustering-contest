      <p>If many of Nigeria’s rich men have the capacity for introspection to see how life has been kind to them, the country would have been a far better place than it is today. Billionaire entrepreneur and Executive Chairman of Geregu Power Plc, Mr. Femi Otedola, reminisced and made a record N5billion donation at the ball organised by the Cuppy Foundation to raise money for Save the Children, the 100-year-old United Kingdom-based charity. The foundation is a non-profit organisation founded by Otedola’s daughter, Florence Ifeoluwa (aka DJ Cuppy).</p>
      <p>“God has been so kind to me in life and I feel highly privileged. The only way I can show my gratitude to him is to use my resources to support those who are underprivileged. This I intend to do for the rest of my life,” Otedola said at the event which was held at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, while making his presentation. He added, “In a world full of conflicts, diseases, calamities and inequality, we all need to show the milk of human kindness, to reach out and comfort the sick and give a helping hand to the weak.”</p>
      <p>The N5billion donation, said to be the largest individual donation to charity in Nigeria’s history, is meant to support various intervention programmes for destitute children in Nigeria’s north-east region. It is instructive that the donation is specifically for the North East because of the peculiar circumstances that part of the country has gone through, in the hands of Boko Haram terrorists. To say that the region has been devastated is putting it mildly. As usual in such war or conflict situations, the most vulnerable segments of the society that serve as beasts of burden are women and the children.</p>

      <p>Instructively too, it is not the first such charitable contribution by Otedola in recent times. He spent roughly N36, 635,000 on former Nigeria’s football team captain, Christian Chukwu’s medical and travel expenses to the United Kingdom, following a stroke attack that he suffered. He said during the footballer’s thank you visit to his (Otedola’s) house that he “was moved when I heard about Mr. Chukwu’s situation because I remember that about 20 years ago, my father, the late Sir Michael Otedola, also suffered a stroke from using fake aspirin.”</p>
      <p>Not long after, he also paid the medical bill of former Nigerian goalkeeper Peter Fregene who had been bedridden for long. Indeed, he moved Fregene from his base in Sapele, Delta State, to posh Reddington Hospital in Lagos, after sending a team to assess his needs. His philanthropy is not limited to the star footballers. The humanitarian gestures also extend to the entertainment sector where Mr. Victor Olaotan, a very popular actor and lead character in the soap opera series “Tinsel,” that he sent to Turkey for medical rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>We salute Otedola’s landmark large heart and commend his example to other rich Nigerians that it pays to help the needy than to engage in ostentatious and obscene lifestyle while there are many people out there who are in dire need of help. He has helped to prolong the lives of the people he has assisted and they will eternally remain grateful for this.</p>
      <p>We commend his daughter, Florence, too, who has taken after her father with her involvement in Cuppy Foundation. Her remarks at the event which was well attended were quite touching: “I stand before you with a big vision for our country and the less privileged. I founded the Cuppy Foundation to give to the less privileged in our society and for people living with disability. The idea for this gala came two months ago, when I visited Maiduguri and met a sick girl that urgently needed blood transfusion. There were many unfortunate children like that. Some were even unlucky and died. The experience was shocking for me. My heart broke. Ever since, my determination to save Nigerian children has been ingrained. I need help from you to help me in fulfilling my calling, not just as a DJ, but as a philanthropist.”</p>
      <p>Like father; like daughter.</p>
      <p>The Otedolas’ kindness has gone beyond the just a little kindness that can make all the difference in the world for people needing help; it is something that should make rich Nigerians who are yet to join the philanthropy train to do so without delay.</p>
