      <h1>China bats away rumours, says trade talks with U.S. continue</h1>

      <p>BEIJING -- China is working to resolve conflicts with Washington over trade, a Commerce Ministry official said Thursday, dismissing speculation the talks might be in trouble as inaccurate "rumours."</p>
      <p>Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said he had no new information to release. But he said China was committed to working toward an agreement.</p>
      <p>"China is willing to address core concerns together with the U.S. on a basis of equality and mutual respect, and to work to conclude our discussions on the first phase" of a trade deal, Gao told reporters at a weekly briefing.</p>
      <p>"This will benefit China, the U.S. and the world," Gao said.</p>
      <p>Financial markets have swung between elation and gloom in recent days as conflicting reports over the talks swirled. Some have cited officials saying they believe a deal is likely by the year's end, while others have expressed skepticism.</p>
      <p>Gao described such reports as "outside rumours that are not at all reliable."</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump began imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese exports nearly 18 months ago, citing trade and technology policies that he says violate Beijing's market-opening commitments and are unfair.</p>
      <p>Since then, tariffs have been raised by both sides on billions of dollars' worth of each other's exports, squeezing farmers and manufacturers. A fresh set of tariffs is due to take effect Dec. 15 on about $160 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S., including smartphones, laptops and other consumer goods.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump had said he hoped to sign a preliminary agreement with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at a regional economic summit in Chile in mid-November that was cancelled due to protests. Prospects for the two leaders to meet and sign a deal soon appear uncertain.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Trump indicated he was prepared to go ahead with more tariff hikes if he does not get a deal with China that he likes.</p>
      <p>The approval this week of a U.S. congressional resolution expressing support for human rights in Hong Kong after months of increasingly violent political protests drew an angry response from China's foreign ministry.</p>
      <p>It also rattled financial markets: markets fell Thursday for a second straight day in most regional markets after losses overnight on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>China took control of the former British colony in 1997, allowing it a semi-autonomous status and separate legal and economic systems. It bristles at foreign comments on matters that it considers its internal affairs.</p>
      <p>China has urged Trump not to sign the legislation, which passed both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate almost unanimously.</p>
      <p>"If the U.S. goes its own way, we will take countermeasures," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.</p>
      <p>But Geng adopted a less fiery tone when asked about the trade talks, reiterating the stance that reaching an agreement is in the best interests of everyone.</p>
      <p>"We hope both could meet each other halfway," Geng said.</p>
