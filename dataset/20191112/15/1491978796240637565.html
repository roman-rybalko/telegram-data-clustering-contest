        <i>McDonald’s workers are organising for better pay – just as the fast food chain launches a menu that claims to make you feel super-rich. Here’s the reality</i>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a big news week for McDonald’s. Just as the fast food outlet launched its festive Millionaire’s menu, some of its UK workers have organised a McStrike in protest against low wages and job insecurity. There is a certain irony in telling customers they can “Live like a millionaire” (that is the campaign slogan) as the people on the tills are being paid as little as £8.80 an hour. I joined the queue to see if the Christmas coffee and doughnut live up to the hype.</p>
      <p>I took the lid off my Millionaire’s latte and was hit by something sticky that felt more solid than airborne. I had to peer into the cup to see it, though. The in-store poster featured a tall red cup with piped chocolate cream coiled well above the rim, a bit like the poo emoji, but mine had melted into the hot drink. Of course it had. (Did you know commercial food photographers use shaving cream to emulate whipped cream?)</p>
      <p>The doughnut looked like a toffee-coated dalek, its surface bejewelled with lots of chewy shortbread bits. I marvelled at how puffy and unsweet it was as I took my third bite and I was suddenly squirting gloopy caramel everywhere. It is a filled doughnut. I am a certified sugar fiend, though, so I felt golden right then.</p>
      <p>A couple of things I noticed on my second visit (I forgot to take photographs first time around) and then on my third (I spilled the second coffee and the cashier mistakenly gave me a plain doughnut). Table service is possible if you eat in. And you can customise the latte with added cream (?!) which takes the whole order over 500 calories (FIVE HUNDRED?!).</p>
      <p>I clearly caught the staff’s attention, as the woman making my final latte whispered: “It’s the same customer” to her colleague at the till. “Yup, I’m beginning to recognise you guys, too,” I thought, because that was my third order and I received neither the pretty red cup with the perfect mound of chocolate cream promised by the advert nor the large cup size I paid extra for three times in a row. But I don’t blame them for any of it, because their salaries and the advert are more than a joke – they’re an insult.</p>
      <p>After that, I couldn’t bring myself to eat or drink any more. The first purchase stuck in my gut like a bad secret. And that was when I realised: that probably is what being a millionaire feels like, at least the extravagant side of having more money than any one person could ever need. That first bite might be a total high, but it’s all downhill from there, and the only person waiting for you at the bottom of the hill is your own damn self.</p>
