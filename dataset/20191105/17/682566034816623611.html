      <p>London - <b>Gareth Bale</b> believes he will be able to play a role in <b>Wales's</b> must-win final two <b>Euro 2020 </b>qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Hungary, Welsh manager Ryan Giggs said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Real Madrid star has been struggling with a calf problem and has not played since scoring for Wales in their 1-1 draw with World Cup finalists Croatia on October 13.</p>
      <p>However, Giggs said Bale is confident he could win the race to be fit for both the game in Azerbaijan on November 16 and at home to Hungary on the 19.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a big injury, but with the short turnaround it's a worry," said Giggs after naming a 27-man squad.</p>
      <p>"I'm in constant contact with him and he feels confident that he'll be fit for the game.</p>
      <p>"It's just monitoring it this week, literally day by day. The last time I spoke to him he was confident he'd be OK."</p>
      <p>The Welsh - surprise semi-finalists at Euro 2016 - are presently fourth in their group, six points adrift of table-topping Croatia and four shy of second-placed Hungary.</p>
      <p>Both Croatia and Hungary have just one game remaining.</p>
      <p>Bale returned to light training with Real Madrid last week after a visit to London sparked more speculation about his future.</p>
      <p>This accelerated on Monday with claims Real Madrid were preparing a 70 million ($90 million) bid plus Bale to lure England striker Raheem Sterling away from Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Giggs, who became Wales manager in January 2018 after Chris Coleman left to take over at Sunderland, said he hoped Bale would get some game time this weekend.</p>
      <p>"That's the ideal situation, that he gets minutes before meeting with us," said the 45-year-old former Manchester United wing.</p>
      <p>"They're huge games and we need to win them (to qualify), we know what we've got to do. We've played against both teams, we beat Azerbaijan and lost against Hungary."</p>
      <p>However, Real coach Zinedine Zidane said Tuesday in Madrid that Bale was still unfit to play, adding "if he is not ready to play for Wales, he won't play."</p>
      <p>Giggs has also called up Juventus midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who could make his first appearance in the qualifiers after recovering from a thigh injury.</p>
      <p>"He's come on in the last two games for Juventus and he's looked sharp," said Giggs.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't say he's 100 per cent match fit but he looks good and he looks sharp."</p>
      <p>Another midfielder Joe Allen, like Bale and Ramsey a pivotal figure in the 2016 team, is named in the squad despite being suspended for the trip to Azerbaijan on November 16.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old - presently playing for second tier strugglers Stoke City - will return for the Hungary game in Cardiff.</p>
