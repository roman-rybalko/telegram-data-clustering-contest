      <h1>What does it mean to be an uncle? I have no blueprint for the love I feel for my nephew</h1>

        <i>When he eats a banana, or vomits on me, or kisses his favourite giraffe toy, something happens</i>
      </p>
      <p>The form had been completed for me, all I had to do was sign. My sister passed a pen across the table. According to the document, I, contact 2, consented to being called by a childcare centre in the event of a medical emergency – provided they could not first reach my sister, her partner, her midwife Karen, or God. At the form’s bottom left, a field blazed with all the possibility of a universe, was the question: “Relationship to infant?” The reply, in my sister’s spidery hand, was uncle. Therein lies the problem: I have no idea what that means.</p>
      <p>Technically speaking, I have been an uncle for over 20 years. At 10, though, the title was primarily a schoolyard boast, to be greeted with a mix of reverence and incomprehension. “An uncle?” friends would ask, noting the incongruity during little lunch. “How does that work?” Chiefly, it didn’t: being the youngest in my family – a child myself – responsibilities were waived by default. It was like dodging the family draft! Even years later, tasked with looking after a then school-aged niece or nephew, the age gap always rendered us closer to co-conspirators than warden and charge.</p>
      <p>The arrival of another sister’s child – her first, a boy, known locally as The Big Rig – presents an exciting opportunity to define such kinship parameters anew. (I recently explained this to him during bath time; he displayed firm in-principle agreement while chewing on a plastic fish.) But it’s hard to know where to start: there seems little in the way of defining these nebulous parents of the second degree. Does the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jemimaskelley/narcissa-and-bellatrix-are-wine-mom-and-vodka-aunt">vodka aunt</a> stereotype imply the existence of a tequila uncle? Would it cause a stir if I turned up to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/gay-uncles-day-seen-instagram-n630576">Gay Uncles Day</a> with my girlfriend?</p>
      <p>My actual uncles make for a pretty odd blueprint: one, Big Bad Billy, would shake your hand and refuse to stop shaking it until you called him “Mr Handshake”; the other, known chiefly as Grub, has lived overseas my whole life and – probably as a result – has excellent phone etiquette. When I worked at an ice-cream sandwich factory, there was a running gag that I was a nephew of its Gen X co-owner. This mostly meant standing around blast freezers talking about the Flaming Lips. As visions of unclehood go, it’s an incomplete picture.</p>
      <p>Lexicography is some help: the Oxford English Dictionary records some five senses of “uncle”, and the general gist is you should display kindness and benevolence; be equal parts protector and patron. But there’s also a negative stereotype of the uncle – those who are <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2019/07/30/your-racist-uncle-was-never-funny/EnMIc4c7RgLNXpjEVnbWnO/story.html">racist at holiday meals</a>, overly handsy elsewhere. This is supported, to an extent, by data: if you look in large English corpora for adjectives appearing before the word uncle, you’ll find “crazy”, “creepy” and “drunk” hanging out alongside “rich”. Not for nothing do <a href="https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/7uyrcfa">historical dictionaries of English slang</a> record the noun “uncle” as a code for pawn-brokers, moneylenders and toilets.</p>
      <p>Despite this confusion, I feel a love for this nephew that I have no prior referent, and scarce little vocabulary, for. When he eats a banana, or vomits on me, or kisses his favourite giraffe toy, something happens. It is difficult, probably impossible, to separate this love for him from the love I have for my sibling, which under Australian emotional law can never be openly expressed. It surely isn’t the love of a parent – there’s not enough fear or anxiety intermingled for that. But, I think, it gets close: luminescence to their incandescence, perhaps. It’s also, on a practical level, very stupid. My nephew won’t remember anything from the next four years of his life, so why bother attempting to communicate to him, as he tries to eat a cloth hat, that I hold him in such esteem?</p>
      <p>Maybe it’s a problem with the term itself: the Latin etymon, avunculus, specifically denoted a mother’s brother. Ordinarily I’d argue against the etymological fallacy – just because the word <i>decimate</i> once meant to kill one in every 10 doesn’t mean more general senses can’t be used<b> </b>– but I think those Romans could be on to something in emphasising the sibling relationship.</p>
      <p>A funny fact: since her child was born, this sister and I have spoken almost every day, seen each other every week. It’s a level of contact heretofore unheard of; our teenage selves would die of embarrassment if they knew. She sends me photos of The Big Rig and in return I bore her to death speculating about his approach to consonants. (His delight when he discovered fricatives!) Perhaps this – the mundanity, the gradual back and forth, the steady tracking of milestones and regressions with a loved one, the showing up – is what it really means to be an uncle?</p>
      <p>Back on earth, I picked up the pen and signed the childcare form.</p>
