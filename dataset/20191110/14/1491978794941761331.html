      <h1>Journalists in the Westminster bubble should stop racing to tweet the news</h1>

        <i>Breaking stories on social media is the new form of scoop journalism and is just as worthless</i>
      </p>
      <p>Veteran journalists working in the pre-digital era were often required to phone in their stories to copy-takers who, after a couple of paragraphs, would often ask: “Is there much more of this?”</p>
      <p>The public could be forgiven for thinking and saying much the same after just a week of electioneering. Broadcast news and current affairs programmes are full of it. Newspaper front pages are devoted to it. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media">Social media</a> is humming with it. And there are still 31 days to go.</p>
      <p>How could it be otherwise? What is so fascinating this time around, quite apart from the obvious fact that so much hangs on the election’s outcome, is the momentous and simultaneous change in both the political and the media landscapes. All the old certainties on both sides of the divide are over. Two-party parliamentary politics is long gone. National newsprint domination of the debate, if not entirely extinct, is on the endangered list.</p>
      <p>Although television still holds the central ground, viewing figures suggest it is gradually losing its audience appeal, especially among young voters. They prefer Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram.</p>
      <p>This double fragmentation, with multiparty politics trying to get messages across to the electorate through multiplatform media, is a particular challenge for mainstream journalists. Their response has been less than overwhelming. They appear to have learned nothing from detractors who complain about arrogance and partisan spin. Thousands of social media postings point to the supposed faults of the mainstream media, while people seem to revel in writing hostile below-the-line comments on newspaper websites. Do editors and reporters simply ignore them?</p>
      <p>Day after day, coverage in tabloids has been predictable and repetitive – self-serving, shrill and sometimes silly. A Sun headline on a story about a Labour frontbencher’s exaggeration of the number of cancelled NHS operations, apart from being inexplicable, brought back memories of postwar Soviet paranoia: “Reds in op ed howler”.</p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph, the paper shaped like a broadsheet but with a tabloid agenda, has been risibly propagandist on behalf of its columnist Boris Johnson. Readers’ letters would suggest it retains their support despite its hysterical coverage. Then again, it is losing readers at a faster rate than its rivals.</p>
      <p>Papers and news broadcasters were soon engaged in that most favoured of election campaign games known as “gaffe-hunting”. Trust Jacob Rees-Mogg to be first out of the starting gate with a crassly insensitive remark about Grenfell. A wealthy Old Etonian, who dresses and talks as if he has time-travelled from the 18th century, is a gift both to journalists and to Labour.</p>
      <p>Several other instances of supposed blunders followed. By far the most interesting, for several reasons, was the “doctoring” of a video of a Piers Morgan interview with Labour’s Keir Starmer. Shared on social media, it suggested that Starmer was lost for words when asked about his party’s Brexit policy.</p>
      <p>Despite a claim by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, that it was not a deliberate attempt to mislead people, it was roundly denounced by a senior colleague, the defence minister Johnny Mercer. Whether true or not, it indicated the Tories are putting great store by social media content.</p>
      <p>The incident also revealed concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook’s policing of false content. Its UK head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/facebook-we-would-let-tories-run-doctored-starmer-video-as-ad">maintained that the network would have allowed the Starmer video</a> to have been used as a paid-for advert on the specious grounds that it had stimulated a “ferocious political debate”.</p>
      <p>That view was not shared by the editor of the Yorkshire Post, James Mitchinson, who was outraged by the posting of the edited clip, contending that it was a “dangerous” stunt. He argued that politicians could not demand respect while deceiving the public. He added: “It’s damaging to your trust levels and demeaning to the electorate.”</p>
      <p>And where did Mitchinson make his comments? On Twitter, of course. It has become the go-to communications platform for journalists, including most national newspaper and broadcasting political editors. After lobby briefings and discreet conversations with their sources, they race to be first to tweet the news.</p>
      <p>It has become a new form of scoop journalism and is just as worthless. Great sport for journalists and those inside the Westminster bubble but, really, what’s the point in the wider world? It is surely time for editors to curb their journalists’ Twitter enthusiasm. They are simply seeking bragging rights: look what I know that you don’t. This showing off is embarrassing and surely counter-productive because it undermines their status.</p>
      <p>Nowhere is this more obvious than at the BBC. Its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, is wearing out her fingers with incessant tweeting.</p>
      <p>All too often, the result of her tweets, along with those of her rivals, such as ITV’s Robert Peston and Sky News’s Beth Rigby, is to generate stories tangential to the central news agenda. In their haste to tweet they also fall into the trap of repeating briefings before they’ve had the chance to feed them through their own journalistic filter. They overlook that famous journalistic dictum when dealing with politicians (and their special advisers): “Why is this lying bastard lying to me?”</p>
      <p>Sometimes, they move into areas that call into question their commitment to impartiality. Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/BethRigby/status/1191982131309948928">Rigby tweeted</a>: “In a party where just one in five MPs are female, the roll call of talented women who’ve just quit the Tories is alarming.”</p>
      <p>She did preface her comment with the word “Views”, but she could face accusations of bias. She appears to have gone out on a limb that her competitors have wisely refused to follow. All, however, can be accused media narcissism. While impressing each other with their tweets, they do little to provide worthwhile information to the public.</p>
      <p>Finally, if you want to track a form of partisanship that becomes more and more evident by the day, count the number of times – on TV, on radio and in newspapers – the prime minister is referred to as Boris and his Labour rival as Jeremy. It’s a no-contest victory for Johnson. Single name recognition gives a political leader a huge advantage.</p>
