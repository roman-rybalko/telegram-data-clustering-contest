      <h1>All the faces we met on the streets of Wonford during the noughties</h1>
      <h2>It's time to shine a light on the characters who have made the red-brick estate what it is through the years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:33:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Miles O'Leary</a></address>
      <p>Remember what Wonford looked and felt like way back in the early to mid noughties? Those were the days.</p>
      <p>It doesn't seem like yesterday the old post office was buzzing with life, Wonford Inn was the place to go and Choy's was still doing a roaring trade.</p>
      <p>We met you at fun days, fetes and jubilee celebrations - ensuring the spirit of Wonford was brought to a wider audience.</p>
      <p>There's so many characters in our archives. So it seems silly to keep them all locked away with nowhere to shine.</p>
      <p>Which is why we've rustled up an epic, rare gallery of the very finest moments from the east red-brick Exeter estate.</p>
      <p>Just hit the link below and take a trip down memory lane. Bet you'll spot someone you know or at least used to!</p>
