      <p>THEY ROSE at dawn, quietly assembling in long queues and clasping their voting cards tightly in their excitement. On November 20th more than 2m people from Ethiopia’s fifth-biggest ethnic group, the Sidama, went to the polls to decide whether to break away to form its tenth semi-autonomous state. It was the first vote of its kind since the introduction of the current constitution in 1995, which granted federal states to many of the country’s biggest or most powerful ethnic groups—but not the Sidama. It also marked the triumphant culmination of a campaign for statehood by the Sidama which dates back almost as far.</p>
      <p>On November 23rd the electoral board announced that 98.5% of voters had backed the new state. This means the Sidama, a people numbering about 5m, will leave the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR), a state made up of a tapestry of more than 45 different ethnic groups of which they are the biggest. A new Sidama state will have its own constitution, parliament and security forces, as well as powers over tax, education, and land administration. But its formation may also fire the starting-gun for the unravelling of an especially fragile part of an already wobbly federation.</p>

      <p>The Sidama referendum was a peaceful and mostly well-ordered affair (though there were allegations of voter fraud in the weeks leading up to it). Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, said the vote was “an expression of the democratisation path Ethiopia has set out on.” It was indeed an encouraging sign that the free and fair national election he has promised next year may happen.</p>
      <p>Local leaders accepted the electoral board’s demands that non-Sidama living in the territory should have a vote. They also agreed to let the state government of SNNPR stay in Hawassa, the multi-ethnic city which Sidamas claim is part of their homeland, for two five-year election terms from next year. This may have helped to defuse tensions between ethnic groups.</p>
      <p>But the road to the referendum was protracted and bloody. After coming to power last year offering greater freedoms, Abiy’s government dithered for months before holding the referendum, which was due to be held in July but was postponed. In the ensuing violence more than 50 people were killed. Since then the whole of SNNPR has been in effect under a state-of-emergency, with the army in charge of security. Dozens of activists were arrested in the run-up to the referendum. Public rallies were banned and soldiers patrolled the streets.</p>
      <p>The ramifications will be far-reaching. The 1995 constitution redefined Ethiopia as a federation of more than 80 “nations, nationalities and peoples” (ie, ethnicities), each with the right to form its own semi-autonomous state or to secede altogether. But for decades the ruling Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) feared the implications of this. Anyone agitating for their people actually to exercise the right was locked up or shot.</p>
      <p>Following the example set by the Sidama at least ten other groups in the south have demanded their own polls. Some, such as the Welayta, fear they will be persecuted in a would-be Sidama state. “Everything is in their hands,” says a resident of Hawassa who now plans to leave. A messy break-up of SNNPR would be dangerous, given the number of territorial disputes and fresh memories of bloodshed. Last year intercommunal fighting forced almost 3m Ethiopians from their homes. Much of the violence took place in the south, including in Hawassa.</p>
      <p>The SNNPR’s future hinges on two factors. The first is how other groups respond to the formation of a Sidama state. Although several demanded referendums a year or so ago none has yet pushed its claims with the force or organisation of the Sidama, notes William Davison of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. Ethnic elites are engaged in a bargaining process that may still end in a compromise that keeps the remainder of the region together.</p>
      <p>The second factor is national politics, ahead of next year’s scheduled election. In recent weeks Abiy has stepped up his plan to form a national party called the Prosperity Party to replace the EPRDF. On November 21st three out of four of the constituent parts of the EPRDF—a coalition of ethnically based parties—approved the merger, which supposedly aims to reduce the power of ethnicity in politics (the ethnic Tigrayan wing boycotted the vote, citing legal and procedural shortcomings).</p>
      <p>The move is controversial and has encountered opposition from many in Abiy’s own ethnic group, the Oromo, who fear it will undermine the ethnic autonomy enshrined in the constitution. The details remain unclear but it is likely the merger will involve more centralised decision-making as well as the dissolution of ethnic parties, including Abiy’s own Oromo Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>The prime minister’s most vocal critic is Jawar Mohammed, an enormously influential activist who last week announced his intention to stand in the promised election. His participation sharpens the central divide in Ethiopian politics, between those who defend what is known as “ethnic federalism”—claiming it is the only way to guarantee the rights of once marginalised groups—and those like the prime minister who would dilute it, on the grounds that too much ethnicity in politics is divisive. In a post shared with his 1.75m Facebook followers Jawar described the Sidama vote as “one in the bag for federalists” and called on like-minded groups to “form or join political parties which unequivocally stand for self-determination.”</p>
      <p>Many in the south may find this message appealing, posing difficulties for Abiy and his new party as they seek re-election. In September Abiy tried to disabuse members of the Kafficho, another southern group that is demanding a referendum, of the notion that statehood was a “shortcut” to solving all their problems. The next few months will show if anyone has been listening.</p>
