      <p>Mozambique’s largest opposition party on Friday called on President Filipe Nyusi to resign after allegations in a US court that he benefited from proceeds of a $2-billion debt scandal.</p>
      <p>The loans were acquired at a time when Nyusi was defence minister and preparing to run in presidential elections in 2014 but were not disclosed until 2016.</p>
      <p>“We demand Mr Filipe Jacinto Nyusi resign immediately as president of the Republic of Mozambique,” Jose Manteigas, spokesman for the Renamo opposition, told a news conference in Maputo.</p>
      <p>He also urged the attorney general’s office to “investigate the truth and consequent civil and criminal liability of all involved in financial fraud”.</p>
      <p>Between 2013 and 2014, state-owned security companies borrowed about $2 billion (1.75 billion euros) from Credit Suisse and Russia’s VTB Bank to buy military and fishing vessels from an Abu Dhabi based shipbuilding company, Prinivest.</p>
      <p>But the government only disclosed the debt in 2016 — a development that plunged the poor, donor-dependent country into its worst-ever financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The United States also alleges that at least $200 million of the loans was spent on bribes and kickbacks to politicians and top officials.</p>
      <p>A Lebanese businessman Jean Boustani, accused of helping coordinate the alleged fraud, is on trial in New York.</p>
      <p>In testimony on Wednesday, he alleged that part of the money went to fund the 2014 election campaign on behalf of Nyusi.</p>
      <p>According to investigations by the FBI, a million dollars went towards the campaign. Nyusi is referred to as “NUY” in email documents produced in court.</p>
      <p>“This is the current President Filipe Nyusi and this was for his political campaign,” Boustani was quoted as saying in official court transcripts from Wednesday’s hearing.</p>
      <p>Nyusi was re-elected to office last month in disputed polls.</p>
      <p>Boustani was arrested in January in the Dominican Republic and sent to the US.</p>
      <p>Nyusi has not responded to the allegations.</p>
      <p>His ruling Mozambican Liberation Front (Frelimo), which is also accused of receiving cash for the 2014 election campaign, has said the president has not committed any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>In a statement cited by the state news agency AIM on Thursday, party spokesman Caifadine Manasse said Nyusi “has nothing to do with debt”.</p>
