Well, it looks like the crows will be flying alone or in pairs through much of the day today in Chennai. Look out for them</h2>

      <p>Vanakkam! Chennai may have stayed mostly clear during the day on Thursday, but thunderstorms returned from 6.30 pm across the stretch from North of Swarnabhoomi to Cuddalore, Kalpakkam, Mahabalipuram, Siruseri, Perungalathur, Ramapuram and Avadi as well as Minjur — all to the South, West, and North of the city.</p>
      <p>Two hours later, another batch of thunderstorms announced their arrival over Siruseri-Kelamabakkam and spread out more by 9.30 pm into the interior, including Maraimalai Nagar, Gudvanchery and Perungalathur. Shortly after midnight, a big one and its entourage lined up along the coast, off Kelambakkam and extending to the seas just off Chennai.</p>
      <p>Most strayed once again just to the South of Chennai from Ramapuram to Siruseri to Kelambakkam to Chengalpattu and Padalam. Potent embers posed right off Chennai at around 2 am this morning, even as a late raid by thunderstorms from the South hit Thoraipakkam, Palavakkam, Velachery and Adyar at 2.30 am, before straying South-West into Thandalam, Tambaram, Perungalathur, Gudvanchery, Kattankulathur, Maraimalai Nagar and Singaperumal Koil.</p>
      <p>The next batch slammed the stretch from Kelambakkam, Siruseri and Thalambur at around 4 am and cut a patch to the South-West by 5 am to Kalavakkam, Thiruporur, Ammapettai, Karumnbakkam, Tirukazhukundram, and Anjur. Another strike at around 6.50 am saw the thunderstorms fan out to the North-West but towards the interior West of Chennai before a lone, weaker storm chose to sit bang over the city at around 7.50 am.</p>
      <p>This was even as areas into the interior of Tamil Nadu to the South-West of Chennai — centred around Sriperumbudur, Pannur, Vallakkottai, Sunguvarchatram, Mappedu, Sengadu, Mannur, Padappai and Oragadam — continued to receive a walloping by 8.15 am.</p>
      <p>So, here’s what the city can expect today:</p>
      <h3>Chennai: 40% chance of rain during the day, and 30% at night</h3>
      <p>Partly cloudy with a 40 per cent chance of rain/ thunderstorms. High at 28 degrees Celsius. Winds to be north-easterly at 19 km/hr.
