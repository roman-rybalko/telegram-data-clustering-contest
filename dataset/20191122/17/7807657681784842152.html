It has unique Your Phone features such as Phone Screen mirroring, the ability to backup photos to your OneDrive through the built-in Gallery app, and a dedicated pen for OneNote and Outlook to utilize. It's rocking the latest Snapdragon 855 processor with up to 12GB RAM and has a monstrous 6.7-inch WQHD display too.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Dell's revamp of its 2-in-1 Ultrabook set the bar for design, functionality, performance, and looks. One of the first laptops with Intel's latest 10th Gen U-series processors, the XPS 13 2-in-1 features one of the best HDR displays with a taller 16:10 aspect ratio, impressive audio, Thunderbolt 3 with Wi-Fi 6 and the ability to easily change form factors giving users ultimate flexibility. It's pure joy to run, but also a reliable workhorse with an all-day battery that is more powerful than expected. The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best of what a PC can be in 2019.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>For years the Razer Blade Stealth has walked the line between a cool looking Ultrabook and something gamers would want as well, but it was never truly a gaming laptop. That all changed this year with the latest Blade Stealth which features an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU - the first of its kind in a 13-inch laptop. Combined with a Core i7 and up to a 4K display, the Blade Stealth is now the most potent 13.3-inch Ultrabook on the market, one we expect to be copied by others in 2020. But for now, Razer has all the glory of portable power and hip aesthetics. For pushing the Ultrabook category forward, Razer gets all the credit.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Perhaps for the first time, Dell's convertible version of the XPS 13 is better than the regular model, and by a good margin. Not only did it come to market as one of the first packing Intel 10th Gen processors, it has a stunning display, features like Wi-Fi 6 and Thunderbolt 3, and most of all, the ability to use it however you want. Fancy scribbling on a tablet? Folding the display out to watch a movie? Or you know, just using it like a laptop. No worries, it can do it all. Toss in beautiful design and construction and an all-day battery life, you have a guaranteed winner.</p>

      <p>The Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is the fifth iteration on a design that is tried and true, making the Pro 7 one of the best 2-in-1 tablets on the market this year. With Intel 10th-gen processors on the inside, the Pro 7 has excellent performance, with features such as instant-on capabilities that see the device wake up instantly when you press the power button. You can get it with up to 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and it even has a new USB-C port for all your USB-C related peripherals. It's rocking a12.5-inch touch display with pen support too, though the pen and keyboard are sold separately.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>While Microsoft has dabbled, the ARM-powered Surface Pro X is at the fore of a new dawn for ARM-based Windows PCs, which enjoy all the benefits of mobile chipsets with many of the productivity benefits of Windows. Although Windows might have some pitfalls to navigate when it comes to ARM devices, the Pro X represents one of the best truly "mobile" Windows experiences to date, with always-on LTE connectivity, impressive battery life, and a ridiculously sleek footprint.</p>

      <p>It's easy to create a thin, portable laptop. It's a whole different ball game to create a gaming laptop with similar dimensions. Razer does so with the excellent Blade range of gaming notebooks. Not only do you get the choice between powerful Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, but also a gorgeous 240Hz matte display. This beast of a portable gaming rig comes with an 80Wh power plant, Wi-Fi 6 support, and can be upgraded to hold up to 64GB of RAM. Not only is this notebook ideal for gaming, but also video editing. The Blade 15 Advanced quickly became our favorite gaming laptop of 2019.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Lenovo's Yoga A940 all-in-one (AiO) desktop PC wowed us in 2019. The Yoga A940 brings up to an 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8700 CPU with six cores, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB HDD coupled with a 256GB M.2 PCIe SSD, and a dedicated AMD Radeon RX 560 GPU for unbridled creative performance, all contained within a custom chassis. Instead of a classic AiO design with everything contained behind the monitor, hardware is split between the display and a large base. That pairs with impressive speakers and a Qi wireless charging pad, as well as an abundance of ports for all your accessories.</p>
      <p>The 27-inch 4K touch display attached to the base can be reclined and extended out for a comfortable drafting position, ideal for use with an active pen. It's a beautiful screen, hitting 100% sRGB and AdobeRGB color gamuts, as well as 95% NTSC. It fixed a lot of the issues we had with Microsoft's Surface Studio 2, and it also happens to be considerably more affordable.</p>

Microsoft's creative solution to storing the pen in the keyboard and the ability to swap out the SSD is an impressive advancement of the always-connected PC category.

With larger keys, more consistent key travel, and a simple plug and play operation, if you spend your days typing, this is the keyboard to do it on.</p>

      <p>Built with direct feedback from professional tournament-level gamers, the new Razer Viper takes mouse tech to the next level. Ditching mechanical switches for Razer's optical solution, this mouse comprises dozens of refinements that make competing mice feel obsolete. Great for both right and left-handed gamers, this is a mouse that demands attention.</p>

      <p>While not cheap, the HyperX Cloud Orbit S is quite possibly the most impressive advancement in PC audio in the last few years. The secret? AudezeTM planar magnetic drivers coming together with Waves NxTM sound processing that tracks your head movements to maintain mind-blowing positional audio awareness. That means is you get a bizarrely realistic audio experience that pinpoints audio to an accuracy never achieved before in headphones. Such tech allows exceptional sound direction and separation key for high-performance first-person shooters. It's awesome.</p>

Blue is a brand many rely on for audio clarity and the new Yeti X offers fantastic value. Blue took everything that made the Yeti great and added some neat new features with a slight bump in audio capture quality.

Because it's using a mechanical HDD, transfer speeds aren't particularly exciting at 120MB/s, but for the price and for what you'll likely use an external storage solution for, it's more than adequate. As a bonus, Seagate includes two months worth of Adobe's Creative Cloud Photography plan, which gives you access to Photoshop.</p>

That's a feature set unmatched by market rivals, still at a budget-friendly price tag.</p>
      <p>While Xbox Game Streaming remains in development, Project xCloud and accompanying remote console streaming will play a more significant role in 2020. And with a free test underway in the U.S. and UK, this small investment draws more value from your Xbox, outside the living room. Simply put, this provides the best Xbox game-streaming experience.</p>

      <p>Capcom raised the bar for video game remakes this year, with the utterly staggering reimagining of Resident Evil 2. Initially built for the PlayStation 1 in the 90s, the 2019 remake showcases Capcom's latest engine advancements without sacrificing what made the original classic so incredible.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Earlier this year, we channeled our inner fowl, bringing chaos to an otherwise peaceful village. You're an endearing goose with a mischievous edge, stirring up mischief and honking yourself through a series of countryside backdrops. Underneath that initial joke, there's a surprisingly gripping stealth experience too, stealing prized possessions and meddling with everyday life.</p>
      <p>Untitled Goose Game isn't exactly replayable, providing just a handful of hours with its $20 price tag. But that's a genuinely original concept from start to finish – and an unexpected highlight of the year.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>This medieval-era story may have flown under your radar in May, but still delivers an unmissable dark tale on Xbox One. Following two siblings caught among the plague chaos, players utilize stealth to escape the trials ahead, while fending off hordes of carnivorous rats. While Asobo Studio may be small, their accomplishments with this title top our annual picks. Assembling a linear, story-driven action-adventure brimming with stealth opportunities, A Plague Tale is a grim, unforgettable glimpse into dark ages, among the highlights of 2019.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>What can be said about Cyberpunk 2077 that hasn't already been said? It's from the creators of The Witcher series and promises to offer a groundbreaking first-person role-playing experience. Not only is Night City larger than the environments in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, but it also features a lot of verticality and complexity. Given CD Projekt RED's past successes in the genre, this game is by far our most-anticipated title for 2020.</p>
