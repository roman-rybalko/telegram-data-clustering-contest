      <h3>Eric Ikhilae, Abuja</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>IN a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court declared on Friday, that no law in the land requires candidates standing for election to submit their  academic credentials to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before they can be  regarded as qualified to contest.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the apex court said that President Muhammadu Buhari was not obliged to attach copies of his academic certificates to Form CF001 which he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) ahead of this year’s elections.</p>
      <p>It also pronounced Buhari  as eminently qualified to contest the election by virtue of the positions he had held previously in the country.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court made the pronouncements while giving reasons for  its October 30, 2019 decision in which it  dismissed  the appeal by the People’s Democratic Party’s Presidential candidate  in the February election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar  and his party against President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>It ruled out of order, claim by Atiku that Buhari lied about his academic qualification and should be disqualified for not attaching the certificates to the Form CF001 he submitted to INEC.</p>
      <p>“On the contention by the appellants that the 2nd respondent failed to attach his certificate to the Form CF001, I am in agreement with the court below that neither the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria nor the Electoral Act 2010 as amended requires a candidate to attach his certificates to Form CF001 before a candidate can be adjudged qualified to contest election,” the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad  said in the lead judgement which he wrote but  read  by Justice John Okoro, a member of the panel that heard the appeal.</p>
      <p>He added: ”The court having taken this position, all the appellants’ arguments in respect to Section 76 of the Electoral Act are of no moment.”</p>
      <p>At the commencement of proceedings yesterday, no lawyer announced appearance for the appellants.</p>
      <p>No big shots of the  PDP were also in court unlike October 30, 2019 when chieftains of the party flooded the court.</p>
      <p>Mr. Alex Izinyon (SAN), who represented Buhari, drew the court’s attention to the strange development and noted that it was against the court’s rules for an appellant to stay away from court when a decision is being taken on the appeal.</p>
      <p>He said  that no lawyer announced appearance for the appellants and wondered if hearing notices were not served on them.</p>
      <p>Justice Okoro, who led a three-man panel, said the appellants were served with hearing notices.</p>
      <p>He said that the court would  proceed with the business of the day despite the appellants’ absence.</p>
      <p>And it did, resolving  the five issues distilled for determination in the 66-ground appeal, against the PDP and Atiku .</p>
      <p>It dismissed the appeal because it was devoid of merit and  the appellants failed to prove, with a scintilla of evidence, their claims.</p>
      <p>The first two issues related to whether the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC)  was right to   hold that the 2nd respondent (Buhari) was, at the time of the election, qualified to contest the election ; and whether PEPC was right to hold that the appellants did not prove their claim that the 2nd defendant (Buhari) submitted to INEC an affidavit containing false information of a fundamental nature in aid of his qualification to contest election for  the office of the President of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The court affirmed the position of the PEPC on the issue that Buhari, by virtue of the credentials tendered, his history of service in the military, the many achievements contained in his curriculum vitae, among others, was eminently qualified to contest the election.</p>
      <p>The apex court held that Buhari met the requirements stipulated in Section 131 of the Constitution, and explained in Section 318 of the same Constitution.</p>
      <p>He said: “I am well guided by the definition given to school certificate or its equivalent in Section 318 of the Constitution. It  is unequivocal to say that the attendance of secondary school up to school certificate level suffices for qualification, without an actual possession of the certificate.</p>
      <p>“My job is not to query the rationale behind the provision, but to interpret and pronounce upon it as I find fit. As I understand the provision, it means that a person, who possesses a school certificate or Grade Two Teachers certificate or its equivalent, a City and Guild certificate, is qualified to contest election into office as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as provided in sub-paragraph A of Section 318.</p>
      <p>“Also qualified is a person, who has been educated up to school certificate level as provided in sub-paragraph B.  In this one, a person needs not obtain a certificate. Mere attendance in a school up to secondary school certificate level will suffice.</p>
      <p>“The Constitution further made the provision simpler in sub-paragraph C, where a person, who has a primary school leaving certificate or its equivalent and has served in the public or private section in the Federation, in any capacity acceptable to INEC, for a minimum of 10 years or attendance of courses or trainings in such institution, as may be acceptable to INEC, and the ability to read, write and communicate in English language to the satisfaction of the INEC, is also qualified.</p>
      <p>“After the Constitution has made specific provision for the qualification for contesting election, it went further to liberalize by stating in subsection 5 as follows: any other qualification accepted.”</p>
      <p>He added that the provision in Section 318 (d) implies that anyone with a qualification outside the one provided under Section 131 and explained in Section 318 is qualified as long as such qualification is acceptable to INEC.</p>
      <p>“I need to emphasize that the Constitution does not require a person to have all the qualifications listed in Section 318 before he is qualified. Possession of one of these qualifications will suffice,” he said</p>
      <p>Justice Muhammad held that the use of the word “or”,and” the section after each of the elements, means that the requirements in the various sub-paragraphs of Section 318 are disjunctive rather than conjunctive, with each standing on its own.</p>
      <p>“This implies that any of the highlighted requirements, being exclusive of the other, will suffice for school certificate or its equivalent. It is only in paragraph C that any person who has a primary school leaving certificate or its equivalent is required to have served in the public or private sector for 10 years or above.”</p>
      <p>The CJN noted that INEC, in demonstration of its acceptance of Buhari’s qualification, had consistently cleared him to contest in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019.</p>
      <p>He identified the academic credentials tendered before the Court of Appeal during the hearing of the petition, including the Cambridge Assessment International Education Grade 2 of 1961; a certified true copy of Confidential Results of the University of Cambridge West African School Certificate and a certificate from  Provincial Secondary School Katsina, and concluded that the PEPC was right to hold that Buhari was eminently qualified to contest the election.</p>

      <p>He added: ”On the contention by the appellants that the 2nd respondent failed to attach his certificate to the Form CF001, I am in agreement with the court below that neither the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria nor the Electoral Act 2010 as amended requires a candidate to attach his certificates to Form CF001 before a candidate can be adjudged qualified to contest election.</p>
      <p>“The court, having taken this position, all the appellants’ argument in respect to Section 76 of the Electoral Act is of no moment.”</p>
      <p>He noted that evidence led by the PDP and Atiku on Buhari’s qualification, including the documents they tendered, like the statement by Army Spokesman, Brigadier Genral Olajide Olaleye and Buhari’s curriculum vitae, worked against the appellants’ interest.</p>
      <p>Justice Muhammad held that the information from the Army spokesman  to the effect that Buhari rose steadily through the ranks to the position of Major General, and the 2nd respondent’s CV contained impressive achievements, even if Buhari possessed primary school leaving certificate, which is not the case.</p>
      <p>“The 2nd respondent has more than the secondary school certificate having attended courses in famous War Colleges in the USA,UK and India. There is no doubt that the 2nd respondent was eminently qualified to contest election to the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”</p>
      <p>On the appellants’ claim that Buhari submitted an affidavit containing false information, Justice Muhammad held that the appellants failed to prove their allegation that he pleaded certificates that he did not have.</p>
      <p>The judge noted that, as against the argument by the appellants that Buhari ought to direct the military to released his certificates, it was the duty of those who alleged that the certificates were either forged or do not exist that ought to call the the Amy spokesman to testify and corroborate their claim that Buhari did not possess such certificates.</p>
      <p>“The 2nd respondent has no business calling the army spokesman; that would amount to standing the law on its head. He who asserts must prove. It is the appellants  who alleged that the 2nd respondent forged his certificate,” the judge said.</p>
      <p>He further noted that the allegation of forgery is criminal in nature and  requires proof beyond reasonable doubt, a responsibility he said, the PDP and Atiku failed to discharge.</p>
      <p>On the variation of  Buhari’s name  which the PDP and Atiku claimed cast doubts  on the documents the court  said: “since the appellant failed to prove that the documents belong to another person and no one else has come to claim them, I have no doubt that the documents belong to one and the same person.”</p>
      <p>On the appellants’ claim that Buhari  was not validly elected  by the majority of lawful votes., Justice Muhammad  said: “From all I have read, the appellants relied heavily on a certain server, where they claimed to have extracted results, which show that they won the election.”</p>
      <p>He noted that although Section 71 of the Electoral Act mandates INEC to maintain a website to give information about election process, the appellants did not claim they extracted the results they tendered from that  website, but a certain server, whose owner they could not establish.</p>
      <p>The judge further noted that the appellants claimed to have retrieved the results from a website: www. factsdontlieng.com, which they said belonged to a whistle blower and a former INEC staff, but failed to identify the said owner and establish that the said server was used by INEC to transmit election results.</p>
      <p>“I am surprised that the appellants did not specifically appeal the lower court’s decision that there was no server. They ought to have known that their game was up having not been able to prove that the server belongs to INEC.</p>
      <p>“I agree entirely with the court below that the appellants failed to prove that INEC has a server from which they got their figures. All the result, calculations and analysis based on the results claimed are of no moment.”</p>
      <p>The judge added that he was satisfied with the finding of the PEPC on the evidence led by two expert witnesses called by the PDP and Atiku. He added “I am satisfied with the position of the lower court that the evidence of PW59 and 60 lacked probative value. I have no reason to hold that the 2nd respondent did not score lawful majority votes.</p>
      <p>On issue four, the court held that the appellants were unable to prove their claim that the election was marred by irregularities and corrupt practices.</p>
      <p>Justice Muhammad noted that while all the offences alleged by the appellants were committed at polling unit level, they chose at trial, to call only five polling unit agents, who ought to be the actual witnesses who saw what transpired at the polling units.</p>
      <p>He also noted that the appellants, at the lower court, failed to demonstrate the documents they tendered, but merely dumped them on the court, without linking them to the aspect of their case where the documents were relevant.</p>
      <p>Justice Muhammed also noted that the appellants failed, at trial, to tender voters’ register, which is crucial to proving over-voting.</p>
      <p>“On the issue of dumping of documents on the court, the makers of the documents were required to be called to testify before the court and demonstrate the relevance of the documents to their case. It was not enough to just tender the documents, the makers needed not to be called. But if it is for the court to act on them, it was mandatory for the petitioners to call the makers of the tonnes of documents they dumped on the court.</p>
      <p>“The monumental allegation of corrupt practices could not be proved by PW62, who said he was at the collation centre. He was not at any polling unit. I am surprised he is described as the star witness. The court below was right to have held that all his evidence was hearsay.”</p>
