      <h3>What's up with the limited options for Android TV set-top boxes?</h3>
      <p>Before we get to that answer, let's clear one thing up first. There are several Android TV boxes available on the market. However, there are only a few that are Google certified, and even fewer certified for Netflix. Beyond that, there is only one certified for Amazon Prime Video — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B075RXV2VR/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU73866YYw">NVIDIA Shield TV (2019)</a>.</p>
      <p>Going a bit further, Android TV's start was extremely rough, leaving sour tastes in the mouths of many. The Nexus Player by ASUS was severely under-powered with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of onboard storage and overpriced, making many interesting balks at buying the device. Despite getting updates as far as Android Oreo — the device shipped with Android Lollipop — the Nexus Player was marred by several issues, such as networking issues and device bricking, the latter happening as recent as Summer 2018.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Razer Forge TV was possibly the worst Android TV box that was released, while the NVIDIA Shield is largely considered the cream of the crop.</p>
      <p>However, 2015 saw the best of Android TV rise, as well as the worst of Android TV make a brief showing. The NVIDIA Shield is a powerhouse of an Android TV set-top box, with access to both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, as well as the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa connectivity, and the ability to become a smart hub via the Samsung SmartThings Link adapter. The NVIDIA Shield TV can also stream games from the PC via NVIDIA GeForce Now or the Steam Link app.</p>
      <blockquote>Android TV is growing, and things are looking quite promising for the platform.</blockquote>
      <p>Missteps such as the lack of Netflix support and not fulfilling their promise to stream games from the PC led to the Razer Forge leaving the market less than seven months later in November of 2015. Additionally, Xiaomi's Mi Box S and the Ematic Jetstream are just as readily available in the United States as the NVIDIA Shield. However, there are more 4K smart TVs that are equipped with Android TV from companies such as Sony, Philips, Sharp, and Hisense, than there are available consumer-grade Android TV set-top boxes. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tvs">One out of every ten smart TVs host Android TV's OS</a>, and even though this trails Samsung's Tizen OS and Roku TV, it's popularity is growing at an amazing clip, as Google takes more stock in its television OS.</p>
      <p>2019 has been extremely generous to those of us wanting more from an Android TV box with the updated release of both the Shield TV and Shield TV Pro. NVIDIA took all of the best traits from its original Shield lineup and brought them along while adding many features that users were looking for. The standard Shield TV has been completely redesigned, while the Shield TV Pro keeps that sleek look from the first generation.</p>
      <h3>If we're making some suggestions</h3>
      <p>The Android TV box that we here at Android Central recommend is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Streaming-Player-Performance/dp/B07YP94PBJ/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU73866YYw">NVIDIA Shield TV (2019)</a>. What makes the NVIDIA Shield a great Android TV box other than the 4K HDR output with Dolby Atmos audio is the integration with Samsung SmartThings, as well as full access to the Google Play marketplace and the included Google Assistant functionality. You can even control your Shield TV box with your Alexa-enabled devices via Amazon's NVIDIA Shield skill for Alexa.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Streaming-Player-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU73866YYw">NVIDIA Shield TV Pro</a>, is fantastic with its updated Tegra X1+ chipset along with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. There are also 2-USB 3.0 ports for storage, keyboards, mice, or even controllers. Plus, you'll get the advantage of Dolby Vision HDR and Atmos for the ultimate home theater experience.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/159229/612734/9383?sharedid=1943169&amp;subId1=UUacUdUnU73866YYw&amp;subId2=dac&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXiaomi-Mi-Box-S-4K-HDR-Android-TV-with-Google-Assistant-Remote-Streaming-Media-Player%2F677842593">Xiaomi Mi Box S</a> compared to the NVIDIA Shield isn't the most powerful device, but for an entry-level Android TV box, it gets the job done. It's one of the few official Android TV-certified boxes and is well known for its capability for 4K HDR output.</p>
