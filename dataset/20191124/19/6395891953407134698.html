      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP)</b> - The Providence Performing Arts Center is offering shows specifically designed to be more welcoming to people with Autism.</p>
      <p>WPRI-TV reports that on Sunday the center is hosting a "sensory-friendly" performance of the Acrobats of Cirque-Tacular.</p>
      <p>A sensory-friendly version of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is scheduled for next month.</p>
      <p>The performances are meant to appeal to people with Autism who may not enjoy all the visual and auditory stimulation of traditional shows.</p>
      <p>The center worked with the Autism Project on the effort, which is intended to make it easier for more people to enjoy a theatrical performance.</p>
