      <p>THE population of the senior citizens in our country is increasing as in the world over. According to 2006 population exercise, those aged 65 years above make up to 4.3 percent of the total population of Nigeria which was put at 140,431,790.  This group are mostly neglected by the government, the public and even the families. Many are lonely especially at 65years and above. Neglect, loneliness and lack of care lead to loss of joy and hope, which lead to premature death.</p>
      <p>According to World Health Organisation (WHO) “Every Person  in every country in the world  should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life. Healthy ageing is a process of developing and maintaining  functional ability which enables all to do what they value at an older age. These include basic needs to learn and grow, mobile, build relationships and contribute meaningfully to society from their wealth of experience. Environments are highly influential on our behaviour, our exposure to health risks (e.g. air pollution, violence), our access to quality health and social care and opportunities that aging brings.</p>
      <p>Since Nigeria is a member-state of WHO, the global strategy is a step forward to contribute to achieving the vision that all people can live long and healthy lives. In Nigeria, the family structure – nuclear and extended – is changing rapidly with no safety net in place for most Nigerians.  The family traditionally was cradle of love, security and development where family needs including those of the aged were met. This bond is getting weaker and eroded due to poverty, societal materialism, competition and independence leading to lack of family support and care of the elderly. There is no social security to also bridge this gap, hence the aged are neglected and unhappy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How could the lots of the senior citizens in our society be improved?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Healthy ageing and retirement education: Many people envisage the idea of retirement as a life stage of leisure, carefree living, relaxation and travelling. With adequate education, preparations including financial, these are possible. We have those enjoying such retirement in our society, however, they are not the majority. To have more people in this group, healthy ageing and retirement education must be organised at all levels of government, private sectors, religious organisations, private sectors, social organisations and communities. This is to be coordinated at the community level, since the senior citizen will eventually settle there after retirement.</p>
      <p>There are some associations, foundations, NGOs and religious organisations working to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being of senior citizens in our communities. All these efforts are wonderful and commendable, but these efforts will yield desired goals if well coordinated. Therefore, coming together to harness all these efforts will be complementary to the WHO’s Global goal of “Every person  in every country of the world should have the opportunity to live long and healthy. This will bring hope and joy to the senior citizens with all the opportunities and values that they will bring to the society from all their life experiences they have mustered over all these years.</p>
