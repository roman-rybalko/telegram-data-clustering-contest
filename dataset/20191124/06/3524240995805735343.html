        <i>OLUFEMI ATOYEBI and DANIELS IGONI, who monitored the governorship and senatorial elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states, write about the violence and irregularities that marred the process</i>
      </p>
      <p>If preparations and assurances by the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies before the just concluded November 16 governorship and senatorial elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states are anything to go by, the two polls become a template for future elections by now.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the reverse is the case. The elections in the two states have been described as one of the worst in the history of electoral process in the country. The elections were rocked with deaths, violence, ballot box snatching, thuggery among other irregularities.</p>
      <p>In Kogi State, the INEC declared Governor Yahaya Bello as the winner of the governorship election after an electoral exercise that was characterized by massive malpractices and violence, including the burning alive of the Women Leader of the Peoples Democratic Party Campaign Organisation in the election, Salome Abuh, in her house.</p>
      <p>INEC also declared as inconclusive, the rerun of Kogi West Senatorial election with the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Smart Adeyemi, leading with a massive margin.</p>
      <p>INEC said Adeyemi had polled a total of 80,118 votes with the Peoples Democratic Party candidate in the election, Dino Melaye, trailing with 59,548 votes. The electoral body said the inconclusive decision was important because the margin of victory was smaller than the votes cancelled.</p>
      <p>Before, during and after the day of the two elections, there were police and other security outfits in security vans everywhere in the state. The state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Busari, had assured the electorate in all parts of the state that safety of their lives and property would be the police priority during the electoral processes. He said about 40,000 security operatives would be deployed to provide security for the election.</p>
      <p>But during and after the election, houses were burnt, people were killed and injured and electoral materials were snatched by suspected thugs who brandished guns to scare the electorate. On the day of the election, six people were confirmed dead with more confirmed dead in post-election violence.</p>
      <p>One of those killed was a nephew of Melaye. He was shot in Ayetoro ward 01, unit 004 about an hour after Melaye voted. Gunmen in two new Toyota Hilux vans and a Honda Civic car stormed the venue, carting away ballot boxes. He was taken to a hospital but died on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Although the turnout was impressive early on Saturday, voters said they were sent away from polling units by suspected thugs who told them to quit the queue if they were not going to vote for a particular political party. The attention of one of our correspondents was brought to this in Okoro-Gbede, Odokoro/Okoro/Araromi and at Ayetoro in Ijumu council area of Kogi West Senatorial district.</p>
      <p>Some of the voters that claimed to have been turned away from polling units in these communities told one of our correspondents that some of the traditional rulers and influential members in the communities were used to influence voting process in the areas.</p>
      <p>Independent observers were threatened and chased away from some areas, journalists were attacked by thugs and there was a claim that INEC officers were forced to sign results sheets that did not emanate from polling units.</p>
      <p>In the past governorship elections in Osun, Ekiti and Ondo states, vote buying was rampant, even though violence was later employed in the supplementary election in Osun with people prevented from voting by thugs and security operatives looking away.</p>
      <p>In Kogi, much of the violence was perpetrated by men in police uniform, although police authorities said they were fake policemen. But the question in the minds of concerned Nigerians is, how did these men have access to so many guns and Toyota Hilux vans and how none of them was caught despite moving from one polling unit to the other, snatching ballot boxes with more than 40,000 ‘regular’ policemen on guard?</p>
      <p>The attacks were also carried out in brazen fashion but according to people who spoke to one of our correspondents in Lokoja, police explanation smelled of inconsistency. When the hotel where Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde and other PDP leaders were staying in Lokoja, was attacked a day before the election, the early report was that thugs in police uniform did it.</p>
      <p>But despite all the irregularities, results were declared by INEC. Many of those who commented on the results said the figures were shocking with particular focus on Okene council area.</p>
      <p>President of the Nigeria Voters Assembly, Mashood Erubami, told one of our correspondents that it was possible for the APC to score high in Okene because it was the domain of its candidate in the election. He however blamed police for the irregularities that marred the election, saying that the claim about the number of policemen drafted to the area was for the purpose of collecting allowance.</p>
      <p>He said, “It is a pity that the same mistakes that INEC and police committed continue to be repeated. It shows that the police have not been doing well. You heard it that the police would send 31,000 policemen to Kogi but it is for the purpose of claiming allowances. If police mobilised 31,000 officers to Kogi, why did we witness all the violence that we saw. Police have not done their job.</p>
      <p>“For any election to be free and fair, it must be supported by all stakeholders, including the police, politicians and the people. The police have always made it difficult for elections to be free in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Talking about the huge result, the trend is that candidates win big in their towns. It makes only little difference anyway because you need votes in other areas of the state to win. Maybe Bello’s people came out en masse to make sure their son won the election. It has never happened in that place before. INEC did what it could by providing electoral materials but where are the 31,000 policemen to protect the voters?”</p>
      <p>Also speaking on the election in Kogi, Secretary General of the Yoruba Council of Elders, Dr Kunle Olajide, said the party which had control over security forces won the election. He also blamed other candidates in the election calling for the amendment of the electoral act before holding another election in the country.</p>
      <p>Olajide said, “It is imperative that we should not hold any other election in this country without electronic voting. Kogi election is the worst form of corruption that you can find in any system. For me, the war against corruption in this administration has been debased by the recent elections in states.</p>
      <p>“This kind of election puts wrong people in the highest administrative positions in Nigeria. We must do something quickly to check this.”</p>
      <p>Olajide said it was a shame that President Muhammadu Buhari had supported the conduct of the election.</p>
      <p>“I cannot imagine he would lend support to the crude and primitive method of election. I also blame the Inspector General of Police. I wonder what his men were doing. Were they overwhelmed by the thugs or how many did they arrest?</p>
      <p>“It was shameful that the IG would go to the public and say the men in police uniform were fake policemen. There were about 40,000 policemen drafted for the election but it is a big shame that things could turn out this way. I have no interest in any of the political parties but we should allow the people to choose their leaders in this country.”</p>
      <p>Similarly in Bayelsa, the atmosphere that pervaded the state on election day was that of a war situation which made the poll a gunboat exercise.</p>
      <p>This state had been known to be a major flashpoint among the states of the federation during elections.</p>
      <p>There was heavy deployment of security forces comprising the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy and Nigerian Air Force as well as the Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, and the Department of State Services.</p>
      <p>Armoured personnel carriers crawled menacingly on the major roads of the state capital and other motorable parts of the state. Some of the gunboats and armoured tanks were stationed at strategic waterways of the creeks and areas such as the roundabout leading to the state headquarters of INEC along Swali Market Road, Yenagoa.</p>
      <p>The premises of the commission were adequately guarded by hordes of security personnel. In and around Yenagoa as well as major roads, the security operatives mounted checkpoints stopping vehicles and interrogating residents. No fewer than 32, 000 police officers were deployed in Bayelsa for the poll with aerial surveillance.</p>
      <p>But despite the heavy presence of security and assurances of peaceful election in Bayelsa by INEC and the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, the governorship election was marred by violence and hijacking of electoral materials as well as officials of INEC in all the eight local government areas of the state.</p>
      <p>Signs that the governorship poll would record violence and other forms of unethical conducts came up during the build-up process on October 16 when a stakeholders’ meeting convened by INEC in Yenagoa was abruptly ended after chieftains of the two leading parties-the APC and the PDP-had heated exchange of words which threw the venue into rowdiness and tension.</p>
      <p>The incident happened in the presence of the National Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who initiated the interactive meeting; Deputy Inspector-General of Police, who represented the IGP Adamu, and heavy security presence around the hall.</p>
      <p>At Southern Ijaw, thugs were said to have intercepted and hijacked voting materials meant for Enewari, Opuama and Angiama areas.</p>
      <p>Similar incidents were reported at Oporoma, Ekeni, Ezetu and Foropa with a collation officer disappearing.</p>
      <p>At Koluama, also in Southern Ijaw, some heavily armed men dressed in military uniforms were seen in 10 military gunboats at the jetty “waiting to hijack electoral materials meant for the area.”</p>
      <p>At Ogbia LGA, electoral materials were said to have been hijacked and set ablaze in Anyama ward 4 by some angry youths who claimed that the materials arrived very late.</p>
      <p>Governor Seriake Dickson and the PDP candidate, Senator Diri, accused the APC of being responsible for the hijacking of voting materials and kidnapping of INEC officials with the deliberate connivance of the military.</p>
      <p>The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, on his part, decried the situation in the Sagbama and the Ekeremor LGAs just as he added that the 2019 governorship election was better than the exercise conducted four years ago.</p>
      <p>The Convener of Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Clement Nwankwo, described the election in Bayelsa State as a major setback to Nigeria’s electoral democracy.</p>
      <p>He charged INEC to interrogate the election in Bayelsa with a view to identifying the high incidences of malpractice that took place and reflect the genuine vote of the people.</p>
      <p>Nwankwo said, “In the light of the security failures, thuggery and general abuse witnessed in the elections, Situation Room calls for an urgent passage and implementation of an Electoral Offence Commission law to address all issues related to electoral abuse.”</p>
      <p>Also, a development expert and political analyst, Philip Slaboh, suggested that the Electoral Act should be revisited to ensure that it permits electronic voting.</p>
      <p>He said this was the only way the recurring issues of electoral violence and vote-buying and selling could be eliminated in the country’s electoral system.</p>
      <p>Slaboh, who is the executive director of Development Initiators, a Yenagoa-based non-governmental organisation, said “We have to revisit the Electoral Act to input electronic voting. This will help to reduce the do-or-die attitude of political actors to elections and eliminate violence in our electoral process.</p>
      <p>“Citizens should be able to vote in national and sub-national elections with devices from the comfort of their homes and wherever they find themselves without going to any physical polling booth. This is what obtains in some parts of the world.”</p>
      <p>The chair of YIAGA Africa, Watching the Votes Count, Dr Aisha Abduallahi, urged President Buhari not to close his eyes to the suffocation of democracy in the country, stressing that the Bayelsa poll was seriously compromised by institutions of democracy.</p>
      <p>Abduallahi, while calling on Buhari to prioritise electoral reforms, challenged him to “leave a legacy of reforms that will end electoral impunity and strengthen democratic institutions.”</p>
