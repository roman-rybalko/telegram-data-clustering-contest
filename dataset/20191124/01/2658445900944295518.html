      <p>THE worlds acclaimed and awarded grand champagne wine and vintage cognacs- symbols of French benchmark bottling was recently unveiled in Lagos with robust tasting, culinary delight and enthralling voyage into its pivotal wineries and key regions.</p>
      <p>Brand custodians, connoisseurs, distributors and wine lovers were hosted to a grand cocktail of music, art expo and wine masterclass last week 14th and 15th November with delicious grilled lamb, savory prawn cocktail and great splendor at the Soul Lounge, Intercontinental hotel, Lagos, where they witnessed the premiere showcase of French appellations and explored the prestige wine culture and art of gastronomy.</p>
      <p>At the French wine rendezvous, brand ambassador from “Les Grandes Chais de France (GCF) led by Jerome Bouynaud, Per Even Allare, Carlos de Ipanema and Gil Cheviron in collaboration with local brand partners including: TEO Ltd, Diberi Global Concept and Benik-E &amp; Company took the guests and wine enthusiasts on France’s unique vision of luxury taste and enchanting adventure into its premium wine regions including the great first growths of Bordeaux, the grand cru of Burgundy and champagne cognacs in Jarnac.</p>
      <p>According to Allare, Hine grand appellation holds the largest collection of single vintage cognacs, and its liquid snapshots captured the essence of a particular year. At the premiere wine masterclass, wine expert and connoisseur Jerome also told the audience that France produces more fine wine than any other nation on earth. France has an advantage in quality wine making in that many of the world’s grape varieties are French including Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah and Sauvignon.</p>
      <p>In the words of the sponsor and brand custodian, Ifeanyi Emechebe, the grand tasting and masterclass by our GCF brand development partners is significant for the brand owners and ambassadors to educate and inspire distributors and wine enthusiasts as part of celebration of French benchmark wineries and world class spirit since no other country produces more great wines and it is a great pride for us to unveil the French appellations in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Bertrand Ndjimi, Chief Operating Officer, Diberi Global Concept, said that the premiere French cock tail rendezvous and masterclass was organised in partnership with the French Embassy as part of its commitment to acquaint local partners and distributors with the secrets of French wine appellations and art of taste as a step forward in expanding distribution networks and consumer experience in the hospitality sector and corporate business.</p>
      <p>The high point of the captivating voyage into French appellations was the exquisite experience and tasting of the grand champagne cognac and Taittinger champagne Prestige rose among other range of world class brands from the stable of TEO Ltd led by its Chairman, Chief Olatunde Onakoya.</p>
      <p>Guests who attended  the event included Sir Steve Omojafor, Dr Ebun Sonaiya, Ambassador Manga Bessan, Eng.
