        <i>Klaus Iohannis easily wins presidential runoff on pledge of restarting judicial reform</i>
      </p>
      <p>Romania’s centrist president, Klaus Iohannis, has easily won a runoff vote as expected, confirming the pro-European trajectory of the eastern EU member state.</p>
      <p>Thirty years after the fall of communism, the centre-right former physics professor won slightly more than 63% of the vote with 95% of ballots counted.</p>
      <p>His opponent, Social Democrats (PSD) leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/i-want-my-countrys-image-to-be-good-has-romanias-ruling-party-moved-on">and former prime minister, Viorica Dancila</a>, received the remaining 37%, the worst-ever result for her party, which has dominated post-communist Romania.</p>
      <p>“I promise to be a president for all Romanians ... A modern, European, normal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/romania">Romania</a> won today,” a jubilant Iohannis said.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old from the German minority, who already staged a surprise win over the PSD in 2014, has campaigned to help build functioning institutions without corruption.</p>
      <p>The election was fought against a backdrop of deep resentment over controversial judicial reforms seen to benefit PSD politicians, which led to massive street protests and irked Brussels.</p>
      <p>The PSD-led government collapsed in October in a no-confidence vote, capping months of political uncertainty under the left-wing party.</p>
      <p>A total of 18.2m Romanians were eligible to vote, including a record 650,000 voters abroad. Part of a four million-strong diaspora who have emigrated in search of better paying jobs, they have tended to favour liberal candidates.</p>
      <p>The PSD government had engaged in a long battle with the European Union over allegations it was trying to push through the measures to neuter the judiciary. Iohannis backed Brussels in the dispute.</p>
      <p>The left-wing party, which was seen as the successor of the ruling elite before the overthrow of communism, had been accused of widespread corruption.</p>
      <p>While nationalism has been less present in Romanian politics than elsewhere in the region – such as in Hungary or Poland – the PSD tried to frame its clashes with EU institutions as evidence that it was standing up for Romania.</p>
      <p>Under the constitution, Romania’s president is responsible for foreign affairs as well as approving the appointment of judges and top prosecutors.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of Romanians have protested against the judicial reforms proposed by the PSD, seen as giving politicians a way to avoid corruption sentences.</p>
      <p>The PSD, which has become increasingly reliant on an ageing, rural electorate, has accused Iohannis of being a “dictator”. Criticised for refusing any face-to-face debate during the campaign, Iohannis, in turn, called his rival the “incarnation of a toxic regime”.</p>
      <p>Dancila, 55, an engineer by training, had highlighted the strong economic growth recorded during the PSD’s time in office, including increases in pensions and public sector salaries.</p>
      <p>But this largesse has sparked concerns by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which has warned about the country’s rising deficit.</p>
      <p>In May, the PSD’s former chief and strongman Liviu Dragnea was jailed on corruption charges, and the party also saw its support plunge during European elections.</p>
