      <p><b>Warren Bobrow: Where are you from? Why cannabis? Did you go to business school? Who is your mentor?</b><b>Peter Miller:</b> I am from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I spend my time now between our corporate headquarters there and visiting everywhere that the ­SLANG network operates, meeting with the team, our partners, and the greater group of stakeholders in our supply chain and business. Cannabis grabbed my attention seven years ago, when Colorado had a ballot initiative to legalize adult use cannabis. It piqued my interest because of the potential that the new market represented and how the cannabis space could have such a great impact. Soon after, I discovered that Canada was exploring a commercial medical cannabis market to handle what had become a pretty large gray market that the government wanted to disintermediate.</p>

      <p> I pursued that opportunity, and through a combination of good timing and many lucky breaks, I became an early license-holder and participant in the Canadian market. Over the next couple of years, I learned a lot about cannabis and ended up successfully exiting that company. At that point, my thoughts immediately jumped to what the next wave of cannabis would be. Ideas crystallized from both my experience in the Canadian market and seeing exciting things happening in the U.S. market.</p>
      <p> My cofounder Billy Levy and I set out to build a company based on our thesis that this whole market would shift to a consumer packaged goods model, and all of the businesses in it would be organized and operated under the rules of CPG and CPG supply chains. That is when <a href="https://www.slangww.com/">SLANG Worldwide</a> was born.</p>

      <p>Yes, I did go to business school. I ended up there through a circuitous path, starting with film school, then withdrawing to work in media for a handful of years. Media was undergoing significant disruption during that period, and while it was an exciting industry, I decided to pursue a degree while continuing to run my small media firm. It was at this point that I met my co-founder Billy, while collaborating with his startup on media content and developing a great friendship.</p>
      <p>I have had the great fortune of benefitting from the experience of many mentors, in different parts of my life. However, like many people, my parents were great mentors. My father was an engineer and my mother was a high-school math teacher when they started their business. They bootstrapped from the start with no outside equity financing or family money, and continue to operate that business today, 35 years later with the same model.</p>
      <p>The dinner table conversation in the early years was hugely educational, although I didn’t realize it at the time, nor did I fully grasp the gravity of the situations in real-time. I spent a lot of weekends with my siblings at their office messing around with swivel chairs and rollerblading through the halls, becoming more useful as I grew up, and ultimately working with the company decades later. The second best teacher to experience, is the experience of a mentor.</p>

      <p><b>Billy Levy:</b> I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. I moved to Florida after high school for college and have been living there ever since.</p>
      <p>I’ve been a consumer of cannabis for as long as I can remember and have had a really good relationship with it – both medically and recreationally. When regulations around legalization started to arise in 2013, I became very interested, as you had this product (cannabis) that is used by tens of millions of people around the world despite it not being legal in most places. Suddenly, we saw legalization and changing regulations creating commercial opportunities that were akin to the end of prohibition, for a product that I knew and loved. It was a great way to bring together my personal interests with what I saw as one of the greatest business opportunities in modern history. </p>
      <p>I don’t have an MBA, but I was a double major and earned degrees in business management and marketing from Florida Atlantic University.</p>
      <p>I’ve been lucky to work with a lot of great people that have taught me an incredible amount along the way. My father had a big impact on me, as did the opportunity to work with Richard Branson at my previous company, which ended up as a Virgin business (Virgin Gaming). Through the many experiences I’ve had both personally and professionally, there are too many people to list that deserve credit as mentors to me.   </p>

        <b>WB: Tell me about your company? What was your inspiration? (Or who was your inspiration?) What is your Six Month Plan? One Year?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>PM:</b> SLANG Worldwide is a consumer-packaged goods company. Our number one emphasis is on great products, branded for consumers. We are most focused on the high-value parts of the supply chain that get our products to market consistently and within our specs every time. Occasionally, we’re involved in cultivation, when cultivation is part of the brand promise or if certain quality thresholds need to be met. We're very involved in the extraction and manufacturing processes, whether that's through operations we control ourselves or through third parties, which we help advise.</p>

      <p> One of our main priorities is our customer relationships, whether that's the retail stores that carry our product or the end user. We don't retail, and the primary reason for this is we don't want to have any channel conflict with those customers. We want to focus on making the retail stores that carry our products successful and not compete with those stores in any way. As you see in the mainstream economy, retailers don’t carry a competing chain’s house brands. We also don't see that in cannabis, so we are being neutral in terms of retail. Thanks to this competitive positioning, our products are carried by some of the great chains in the industry.</p>
      <p> I think where we are today, as an industry, supports our thesis that the CPG business model is the future and will lead to long-term value creation in the space.</p>
      <p>The inspiration for SLANG came from the trips Billy and I took to the U.S. to gather information, find talent and generally monitor the development of the industry while we were building our business in Canada.</p>
      <p> We were inspired by the rapid development of cannabis goods as they went from simply flower in jars with a label associating a certain strain (and sometimes not), to more sophisticated form factors. We saw the original O.Pen on an early trip to Colorado and we were really impressed by it. We immediately felt that this was the direction that cannabis was going. While we were building a vertically integrated business in Canada, in a bit of a cannabis industry silo, we kept popping back into the U.S. to see what was going on in other markets.</p>
      <p> We got incredibly excited by the growth and product development we saw in the different U.S. markets and when our first cannabis business was acquired by Canopy Growth, we spent time reflecting on our experience and thinking about our goals. In the end, we agreed that we wanted to be in the most mature markets where these form factors and new business models are developing, and most viable. That inspired us to start SLANG and to acquire and develop great brands to participate in this next wave of cannabis legalization as a consumer packaged good.</p>
      <p>In simple terms, our six month and one year plans are the same to the extent that we plan to sell more servings of our brands than in the previous periods. To get more specific, I think that six months out has us doing a lot of the tactical work to shore up more of the supply chain, get the markets that we are in to a more stable position and increase our presence in our more mature markets. A year out, I think you'll see us exploring more brand extensions, and new products and categories. We have an exciting new loyalty program rolling out to replace a previous iteration, and several other product advancements across the portfolio. Overall, 2020 is shaping up to be an exciting year for SLANG as we continue to diversify our portfolio and create innovative new solutions for consumers.</p>
      <p><b>BL: </b>SLANG worldwide is a leader in branded consumer goods within the cannabis industry. We have a diverse portfolio of brands, across all major product verticals (vaporizers, edibles, concentrates, &amp; beverages), the majority of which perform in market leadership positions in locations where they are available. We have a presence in 12 states and have product sold in over 2,600 retail stores. We provide more than just a product: we bring people together for the shared experiences made possible through cannabis, no matter the usage. SLANG doesn't just deliver branded units, we are the market-leader in branded cannabis experiences.</p>
      <p>Our prior business, Mettrum Health Corp., was also in the cannabis industry. It was a vertically integrated company that did everything along the supply chain from cannabis seed to sale. This experience had a great outcome given the acquisition by Canopy Growth. However, operationally we learned vertical integration was very challenging to scale – it’s hard to be a good farmer, processor, manufacturer, brander, marketer, sales, and retailer. The experience and associated realities helped form our thesis that cannabis products were going to be a new category within consumer packaged goods, so we looked at CPG companies like Coca-Cola, P&amp;G, Unilever, Nestle, and PepsiCo for inspiration.</p>
      <p>We are focused on expanding the leadership positions of our brands in the markets that we operate in. Additionally, we look to partner with great operators in emerging markets that are earlier in their legalization journey. We like to work collaboratively to organically build brand awareness in these markets as they mature. At the end of the day, all plans revolve around delivering consumer’s great experiences and in doing so, developing strong relationships between consumers and our brands. We accomplish this by offering a diverse selection of products that meet the evolving needs of cannabis consumers, while also ensuring our portfolio’s branded products are available in as many locations as possible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: What obstacles stand in your way? How do you propose removing those obstacles? What market do you most want to enter? Why?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>PM:</b> In the cannabis industry, the obstacles are not always the intuitive ones. What most businesses take for granted, the cannabis industry has often struggled with. From the most basic stuff around taxation of the industry, to the traditional services that business would expect like banking, we all struggle with similar things. Our business, specifically, has the added challenge, but also the opportunity of trying to deliver products consistently to consumers in multiple markets, multiple regulatory frameworks, etc. It's a challenge, albeit an exciting challenge, to try to navigate the nuances and idiosyncrasies of all those different regulated markets with the goal of delivering a consistent product in each of those places.</p>
      <p> So for example, the O.Pen or District Edibles can be enjoyed on vacation in Las Vegas or at home in suburban Colorado. In any territory in which we operate, our products will look familiar to the consumer and will be consistent and deliver the same experience. We like any market where the cannabis consumer can freely interact with the industry. Colorado is a great example of a market that as it has matured, it has become easier and easier for the customer to safely interact. You can walk into a store, ask questions, have an answer provided by a well-informed budtender and leave with any number of high-quality products.</p>
      <p> There are new markets that show a lot of promise in that direction, but we think that every market that matures with generally similar regulation will be super exciting. Florida, even if it’s only a medical market right now, really stands out to us. We're seeing a lot of pick-up of our brands and a lot of servings being enjoyed by consumers. We believe it has the support to become a recreationally legal market on a ballot initiative next year, so that market is really exciting to continue to go deeper in. And of course, the big population centers of the Northeast and the Midwest present a lot of opportunity. When Illinois goes legal for recreational use and the regulations allow for more mom &amp; pop players, and participants, generally, I think it will be an even more exciting market.</p>
      <p> I also think that every legal cannabis state in the U.S., as they mature, are exciting to us, as a business, because it means our products can be sold and enjoyed in more and more places. It also presents a solution, for consumers who want a quality experience and don't want the stress and uncertainty of transacting in a gray or black market.</p>
      <p><b>BL:</b> There are a significant number of obstacles due to the nature of our business, and the (lessening!) taboo around cannabis. Generally speaking, as an entrepreneur, I’ve found things mostly never go as planned – there are always problems and challenges – that’s what keeps things interesting! The key for me distills down to solution-oriented thinking. Things will always go wrong, but how you deal with that defines who you are. With that in mind, I don’t feel like there’s anything we can’t overcome– we have an incredibly capable team with decades of collective experience, a diverse product portfolio, and a great retail presence.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: Do you cook? If so, what is your favorite thing to prepare? Who taught you? What’s your favorite restaurant? Where?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>PM:</b> I am not a good cook by anybody’s standards, except my two-year-old’s who thinks I make scrambled eggs and pancakes really well. He doesn’t know the pancakes are made from a pre-mix. I cook for him every day that I'm home, but other than that, no one wants to taste my cooking. I am “self-taught” as in, I read the directions on the pancake box and executed them accurately. Like everything in life, you take available data and execute a plan with that data, and your relative skill-set, in mind. In business, I try to surround myself with people who are better than me at each piece of the business, so the combination can really excel.</p>
      <p>Wow, well my favorite restaurant and its location would just be anywhere that I can enjoy a peaceful meal with good friends and family. That could be in any given country at any given time. Ideally there is a lot of rich desserts on the menu.</p>
      <p><b>BL:</b> I try! My favorites to prepare are really any type of breakfast and for lunch or dinner, any type of pasta. I’ve learned to cook in the most 21st century way possible– through services like Blue Apron. I’m grateful to live in a point in history where these types of services streamline something we all enjoy– great food– but make it accessible for me and those like me. I spend the majority of my time on the road visiting SLANG Network partners, so it’s always a relief to come home and enjoy a meal prepared in my own kitchen. </p>
      <p>Red Farm in Manhattan is my favorite restaurant.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: What is your passion?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>PM:</b> My passion is just life, generally, and the family, friends, and colleagues that occupy it. I have a great family, I get to work in a phenomenal industry, with a wonderful team of people who bring a similar passion to their work and lives. On the good days, and the challenging days, this life is a privilege that I am grateful for and passionate about.</p>
      <p><b>BL: </b>Our business. It sounds cliché, but I’ve been super fortunate to do things that I have interests in (gaming and cannabis) and consider myself lucky to work with a lot of really great people.</p>
