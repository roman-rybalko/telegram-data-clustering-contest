      <h1>Ridesharing While Female: The Unacknowledged Consequences of Getting In A Stranger’s Car</h1>

      <p>There used to be two axioms of personal safety we all took for granted: don’t get into cars with strangers, and don’t meet people from the internet. It seemed pretty straightforward; you don’t know people’s intentions, and a stranger is a stranger is a stranger, regardless of how they may present themselves. It was a simple precaution for personal safety in an age where we were all far less connected – and as a result, far less trusting.</p>

      <p>But times have changed, and in 2009, Uber came along and “getting into cars of strangers from the internet” rapidly became normal. Uber was soon joined by competitors like Lyft, transforming the rideshare model into a major disruptor of the taxi industry which, in fact, has had to adapt to the upstarts’ model. The famous yellow taxis of New York City, for example, introduced an app called Curb for scheduling pickups and contactless payment for street hails. In other words, rideshare apps changed everything. But not always for the better.</p>
      <p>Because, at the end of the day, you’re still getting into a stranger’s car, and no technology can mitigate that fact. Sure, you may have their name and picture and documentation of when you were in their car and where it went, but that’s not always a deterrent, as a spate of women coming forward in the last year to share stories of kidnapping, assault, and rape at the hands of their drivers attests.</p>
      <p>This fact has come to renewed public attention this week after writer Lauren Ranken<a href="https://twitter.com/laurenarankin/status/1191398757239148544?s=21"> tweeted</a> in support of rape survivor Alison Turkos, pointing out that the new terms of service Lyft put in place (which some believe to be in response to Turkos suing the company for failing to take reasonable measures to protect passengers) in August 2019 contradicts their stated safety policy. Riders must agree to forgo the right of both a jury or bench trial in the event of a “dispute” with the company, instead accepting individual arbitration for <i>all</i> claims against the company except those specifically noted. You might perhaps expect that those specific classes of dispute would include abuse, assault, rape, and kidnapping alongside such boilerplate exceptions like small claims and workers compensation. But it doesn’t, and despite the company’s<a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012923127-Safety-policies"> publicly stated policy</a> that no such arbitrations would be required, it’s a legally binding contract.</p>
      <p>At this point, out of fairness to the company, I want to make clear that this situation is still developing, and the discrepancy between policy and terms of service remains unexplained and the consequences unclear. I don’t want to presume bad faith. While the timing (following a considerable number of allegations and lawsuits) and specifics (explicitly denying customers the right to class action) are worrisome, at bare minimum this represents a significant dereliction not only of the safety of Lyft’s riders, but its responsibility to bear any consequences.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://medium.com/@alturkos/why-im-suing-lyft-6a409e316d1f"> kidnapping and rape allegations of Alison Turkos</a> are disturbing, but perhaps moreso is her contention that the driver remained in Lyft’s employ, although prevented from specifically driving Turkos herself. There is in that a shocking disregard for the women who <i>do</i> end up in this man’s car, a disregard for women which seems endemic in a Silicon Valley still dominated by a tech bro culture, best exemplified, perhaps, by ousted Uber founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, who reportedly quashed a long history of sexual harassment allegations within Uber (though not directed at Kalanick himself). The lack of accountability in these terms of service places an enormous number of women at risk – and makes coming forward and seeking restitution and change more difficult. After all, if women aren’t permitted to band together as a class to tackle <i>kidnapping and rape </i>enabled by a company’s negligence and/or willfull ignorance, I’m not sure what we can honestly expect to change. Frankly, women deserve better.</p>
      <p>The question, then, is what “better” looks like. As I said at the outset, no amount of policy is ever going to change the simple arithmetic that sometimes motive meets means and opportunity in catastrophic ways, and some men are going to take advantage of that fact to get what they want, damn the torpedoes. </p>
      <p>But the companies we entrust with our safety need to be held accountable and need to do their due diligence in order to protect their customers. The harder we make it for companies to be blasé about this sort of thing, the harder we make it for abusers to ply their trade – or at least to do so on an ongoing basis. Remember, these are private companies, not the justice system, and they aren’t incarcerating alleged abusers. They have an obligation to put the safety of their customers first, or else bear responsibility for allowing them to be harmed while in their care (and continuing to allow it by looking the other way and failing to take reasonable action). Terms of service agreements that restrict riders’ legal rights to seek redress only discourage women from reporting what happened to them and leaves the door wide open to further harm.</p>
      <p>The grand story of our age has been the technology sector’s unwillingness to own up to its own role in perpetuating human misery. From Facebook to Twitter to Lyft, rather than direct their efforts toward addressing blindspots and combating harm, they instead prioritize shielding themselves from consequence.</p>
