      <p><i>Citizens happy with announcements, want more clarity on role of Mobility Management Authority</i> <br/><br/>Citizens have welcomed the initiatives announced by the Chief Minister on Wednesday, but are cautious about the plan’s implementation. BS Yediyurappa had announced the setting up of a Bengaluru Mobility Management Authority (BMMA) to tackle the traffic issues that make a single authority manage all the transport agencies. <br/><br/>Civic activists are seeking clarity on the role of BMMA and wonder if it would be different from UMTA (Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority). <br/><br/>UMTA had been planned as an umbrella body for all transport agencies such as BMRCL, BMTC and suburban railways. <br/><br/>Srinivas Allavali, co-founder, Citizens for Bengaluru, says, “We are not sure if it is the same agency planned under a new name or if it is a different entity altogether.” Earlier, Bangalore Metropolitan Land Transport Authority (BMLTA) was formed in 2007 to play the same role but it’s not been active. <br/><br/>Sandeep Anirudhan, founder, Citizens Agenda for Bengaluru, adds that even if the BMMA is formed, it should be made answerable to the BBMP council to strengthen the local governance. He says, however, that one of the announcements to extend the Metro network to Hoskote, is unnecessary. “The Metro would be more expensive to set up. As we already have infrastructure for the railways and since the suburban railway has been approved by the Railway Board, we should focus on upgrading it with automatic signalling at all areas and on increasing frequency of the trains. It would also cost about Rs 10 crore per km to set up the railway line while expenditure for Metro would be about Rs 350 to Rs 400 crore per km,” he says. <br/><br/>Many also say that the suburban railway should not be considered as a substitute for Metro. Ashish Verma, associate professor, civil engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), says, “We need both the Metro and suburban rail connectivity where there is demand for these. That is why we need a unified transport authority so that there is no competition between different public transport systems. The single operator would help create a seamless experience to encourage people to switch to public transport.” <br/><br/>The CM had also announced the introduction of 6,000 more BMTC buses. However, citizens say it should be planned well and be allocated to routes where frequency has to be upped. “Currently, we have more BMTC services where we do not need so many buses and in the areas where more are needed, we do not have them. Bengaluru does need 6,000 more buses but route rationalisation should be kept in mind while introducing them. We should have local loop buses, that is buses only to travel to and fro Indiranagar 100 feet road. This would encourage more people to leave thier cars and use public transport,” says Allavali. <br/><br/>He adds that it is a good decision to reduce the fare of the buses. “Bengaluru has the highest of bus fares in the country. We should introduce more buses,” he says.</p>
