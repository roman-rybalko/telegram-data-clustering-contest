      <p>Senator Kamala Harris introduced the Family Friendly Schools Act on Wednesday. The bill would create afterschool and summer programming to align the workday with the school day to help working families. Current school schedules often leave working parents looking for childcare from the end of the school day to the end of the workday and throughout the summer. The legislation would create a pilot program at 500 elementary schools serving a high number of low-income families to offer programming from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday throughout the school year. It would award five-year grants of up to $5 million to school districts to work with community partners to create developmentally appropriate afterschool activities like academics, music or athletic programs. These schools would also have free full-day programming on days that schools are closed for parent-teacher conferences and other days that are not federal holidays. </p>
      <p>The bill would not affect the number of hours teachers and staff work, unless they choose to work more hours to earn more income; additional educators would come to school to work during the extended hours. The legislation would provide $1.3 billion annually for 21st Century Community Learning Centers to allow up to 1.8 million more children to have access to summer programming. As a mandate of the bill, The Department of Education would publish a report at the end of the five-year grant to show the impact on parents, teachers, students and school administrators.</p>
      <p>The bill, which is also sponsored by Senators Kirstin Gillibrand, Richard Blumenthal, Jeff Merkley, Sherrod Brown and Michael Bennet, has the support of organizations including American Federation of Teachers, Center for American Progress and the Institute for Educational Leadership. “The misalignment between school and work schedules puts working families through unnecessary financial stress – a burden we know is disproportionately shouldered by Black and Latinx families and families with low incomes,” Catherine Brown, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress said in a <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-family-friendly-schools-act">statement</a>. “Senator Harris’ proposal would better support families in arranging child care and their work schedules, enabling more parents – largely mothers – to work, advancing educational equity and providing a needed boost to our economy.”</p>
      <p>Wealthier families are able to pay for afterschool activities for their kids and this bill would make the opportunities accessible for more families, Sarah Cohodes, a professor of economics and education at Teachers College at Columbia University, told <i>Forbes</i> in an interview. “<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/VuwgCVOJM3sXzLQNfzoPat">Research on expansions of preschool and kindergarten</a> shows that these programs generally increase mothers' labor force participation, particularly for low-income women. This policy would likely have the same effect, influencing working mothers the most, since moms are typically the parents who provide or find childcare,” she said. </p>
      <p>Timothy Daly, the founding partner of the education non-profit EdNavigator says the bill will help more parents, and especially mothers, stay in the workforce and advance to leadership positions. Daly thinks that employers would welcome the legislation. “When employees miss work, it hurts the employer and can lead to tension between the employer and employee. One of the biggest reasons we see people struggling to remain in a job is childcare related,” he told <i>Forbes </i>in an interview. When both parents work they will need to weigh if their salary is enough to cover childcare costs. “Senior executives can pay for nannies and activities because their salary is so high that they can afford it. Hourly workers struggle with that question differently,” he says. </p>
      <p>“My mother raised my sister and me while working demanding, long hours,” Harris said in a <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-family-friendly-schools-act">statement</a>. “So, I know firsthand that, for many working parents, juggling between school schedules and work schedules is a common cause of stress and financial hardship. But, this does not have to be the case. It is time we modernize the school schedule to better meet the needs of our students and their families.”</p>
