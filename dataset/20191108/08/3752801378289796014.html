      <p>A missing Durban woman who was brazenly kidnapped from Pinetown six months ago has been found, the Hawks confirmed on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We will provide more information at a later stage, but I can confirm that she is recovering in hospital," Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told News24.</p>
      <p>Sandra Moonsamy, the 40-year-old financial director of multi-billion rand company Crossmoor Transport, was found after an operation in Mamelodi, Pretoria, said the Hawks. Other <a href="https://witbanknews.co.za/138993/found-six-months/?platform=hootsuite">media reports</a> however said she was found in Witbank in eMalahleni.</p>
      <p>"We have arrested four people at this stage. I believe some firearms have been recovered, but I will confirm that later," said Mulaudzi.</p>
      <p>Moonsamy was kidnapped in May on the M13 on Stapleton Road in Pinetwon, while driving her black Range Rover.</p>
