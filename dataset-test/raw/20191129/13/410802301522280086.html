Besides the hosts recording innings victories in both Tests, there was something else that stood out.

Over on New Zealand’s North Island, the Kiwis’ wicketkeeper/ batsman scored 205 to earn himself the man-of-the-match honours. Guess what?

      <p>Mount Muanganui and Brisbane might be 2 436km and a big chunk of the Tasman Sea apart, but very similar circumstances played out in both cricket venues last week.</p>

      <p>At the Gabba, Australia’s No 3 batsman was named man of the match against Pakistan for his superb 185.</p>
      <p>Over on New Zealand’s North Island, the Kiwis’ wicketkeeper/ batsman scored 205 to earn himself the man-of-the-match honours.</p>
      <p>Guess what? Both Marnus Labuschagne and BJ Watling are South African born.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne – or Labooshane, as the Aussies call him – hails from Klerksdorp and Watling from Durban.</p>
      <p>And, quite ironically, they both left Mzansi with their parents at the age of 10.</p>
      <p>And another fellow who actually stayed in South Africa into his 20s, Neil Wagner, was instrumental in the Black Caps’ demolition of England.</p>
      <p>The left-arm seamer, who turned out for Northerns a dozen years ago, floored Joe Root’s side by taking 5/44 on the final day.</p>
      <p>Proteas fans don’t need any reminding that the man who sent them home during the 2015 World Cup – Grant Elliott – was in fact a<br/>South African.</p>
      <p>Not to mention wicketkeeper Kruger van Wyk, who wore the gloves before Watling.</p>
      <p>When it comes to England, we can discuss the number of South Africans who have turned out for them over the last decade until the cows come home.</p>
      <p>Kevin Pietersen is the most notable, but don’t forget the likes of Jonathan Trott, Keaton Jennings and Jade Dernbach.</p>
      <p>Hence the old joke: “Where do the England players stay when they tour South Africa? At their parents.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, over in Ireland, ex-Griquas all-rounder Andre Botha had a hand in their glorious run at the World Cup in 2007, while ex-Affies man Thinus Fourie also turned out for them later that year.</p>
      <p>Ryan ten Doeschate, Wesley Barresi and Roelof van der Merwe all turned out in orange colours for the Dutch.</p>
      <p>Dewald Nel, another product from Klerksdorp, turned out for Scotland and former Proteas limited-overs seamer Rusty Theron is wearing the colours of the US these days.</p>
      <p>Former Proteas Test spinner Simon Harmer is setting the county scene alight as a Kolpak player and its very likely he could play for England once he qualifies.</p>
      <p>And it’s not only our players making names for themselves overseas.</p>
      <p>South African coaches have been very active too.</p>
      <p>Gary Kirsten is the best example, after winning the World Cup as India coach in 2011.</p>
      <p>Another former Proteas coach Mickey Arthur has had stints with Australia and Pakistan, while counterpart Russell Domingo is in charge of Bangladesh these days and Lance Klusener of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>All these coaches have been part of the Proteas set-up – but there is no guarantee that the players would have even been considered for higher honours had they stayed on.</p>
      <p>And therefore I’m not trying to beat the familiar old drum of suggesting that we erred somewhere by allowing them to slip through the net – but rather use them to illustrate what an influence South Africans have on world cricket.</p>
      <p>So how the hell is our own back yard in such shambles?</p>
