      <p>Once the votes have been counted and a new MP for Rushcliffe is announced, it will officially mark the end of the political career of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/ken-clarke-rushcliffe-brexit-country-3297278">Ken Clarke</a>.</p>
      <p>After a remarkable 49 years representing the constituency in which he was born, after Thursday's General Election the 79-year-old will have plenty of time to pursue his passion for jazz, cricket and Nottingham Forest. Although it is unlikely that he will disappear from politics altogether.</p>
      <p>Anyone interested in finding out exactly what he'll be getting up to can ask him directly when he makes an appearance at Nottingham Playhouse on Friday, February 14.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ken-clarke">'Father of the House of Commons'</a> will be in conversation with award-winning LBC radio presenter and CNN political commentator, Iain Dale, discussing his five decades in politics, as well as his views on Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Britain.</p>
