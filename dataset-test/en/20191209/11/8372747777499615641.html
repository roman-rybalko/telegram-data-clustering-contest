      <p>Walmart is saying sorry for making available a Christmas sweater with an apparent drug reference.</p>
      <p>The sweater featured an image of Santa Claus<b> </b>behind a table with three white lines that look similar to cocaine lines. Below the image is the phrase "Let it snow." The Global News, a Canadian news organization, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6267927/walmart-canada-christmas-sweaters-cocaine/">first reported the apology</a> .</p>
      <p>"These sweaters, sold by a third-party seller on Walmart.ca, do not represent Walmart's values and have no place on our website," Walmart said in a statement on Saturday. "We have removed these products from our marketplace. We apologize for any unintended offence this may have caused."</p>
      <p>Walmart declined to comment further on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Third-party sellers are able to make products available on <a href="https://marketplace.walmart.com/">Walmart Marketplace</a> — a portal on which Walmart can approve sellers to use its website.</p>
      <p>Walmart has faced similar issues before. In 2017, the company <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/17/news/companies/walmart-racial-slur/index.html">apologized</a> for an offensive slur used by a third-party seller in a product listing on its website.</p>
      <p>And it's not the first time this holiday season that a third-party seller has brought scrutiny to a major online retailer. Earlier in December, Amazon <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/02/tech/amazon-auschwitz-products-removed-scli-intl/index.html">pulled</a> Christmas ornaments showing the Auschwitz concentration camp. Images used showed the train tracks leading to the entrance of Auschwitz II-Birkenau and a number of scenes inside the camps, where around 1 million Jewish people are estimated to have been killed during World War II.<b> </b>Amazon removed the products when the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted about them.</p>
