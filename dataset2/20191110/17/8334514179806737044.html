      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic ruthlessly took Matteo Berrettini apart at the ATP Finals on Sunday as he began his quest to reclaim the number one ranking by winning his opening group match 6-2 6-1.</p>

      <p>Roger Federer already faces an uphill task to win the title for the first time since 2011, however, after being outplayed by inspired Austrian Dominic Thiem, losing 7-5 7-5.</p>
      <p>Thiem had never won his opening group match in his three previous appearances but took full advantage of a unusually sluggish Federer to make a flying start.</p>
      <p>While six-time champion Federer will fancy his chances of steadying the ship against Berrettini on Tuesday, he will likely need to beat Djokovic on Thursday to reach the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Only once in 16 previous appearances has Federer not survived the group stage, back in 2008.</p>
      <p>Berrettini, the first Italian to play in the season-ending showpiece since 1978, was given a harsh lesson by 16-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Djokovic began the match 640 points behind Rafael Nadal in the race to end the year on top of the rankings, but victory chipped that advantage down to 440.</p>
      <p>Djokovic must at least win two group matches and reach the final to have any chance of matching Pete Sampras’s record of ending six separate years as world number one.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Nadal, who has concerns over an abdominal injury sustained at the Paris Masters, plays his first group match on Monday against defending champion Alexander Zverev.</p>
      <p>As an opening singles match in a tournament featuring the world’s best eight players, it was a disappointing spectacle as the 23-year-old Berrettini succumbed all too easily.</p>
      <p>The first four games were shared but once Djokovic got into his metronomic groove he looked untouchable and the errors began to flow off his opponent’s racket.</p>
      <p>Berrettini snatched at a forehand at 2-3 to gift Djokovic the break and in no time at all he was a set and 4-0 down.</p>
      <p>Djokovic had a momentary lapse to drop serve but was in no mood to hang around as he racked up his 36th win at the event.</p>
      <p>He did have some sympathy for his opponent though.</p>
      <p>“I remember when I played for the first time in the ATP Tour Finals in 2007, I lost all three matches in the group,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I was tense. It’s a lot of pressure mentally, that you have to deliver your best, where for us guys that have been playing on the top level for many years, we have the experience.”</p>
      <p>The evening match was much more entertaining as Thiem, runner-up at the French Open to Nadal in June for a second successive year, took his career record over Federer to 5-2.</p>
      <p>He broke serve in the opening game and although Federer hit back impressively Thiem was the more aggressive player throughout, using his forehand to keep Federer on the back foot.</p>

      <p>Federer buckled under pressure at 5-5 in the opener and Thiem confidently held in the next game.</p>
      <p>It felt like Federer was just hanging on in the second but he offered up three break points at 5-5 with a volley error.</p>
      <p>Serving for the match, Thiem missed one match point and had to save a break point as Federer dug in but he made no mistake at the second time of asking, pummelling away a forehand to seal a third win over Federer this year.</p>
