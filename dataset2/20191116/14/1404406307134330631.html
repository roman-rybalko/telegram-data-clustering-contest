      <p>Will.i.am recently took to Twitter to air out an airline, mainly a flight attendant after she was reportedly racist to the artist during an onboard altercation.</p>
      <p>Will.i.am said “<i>I’m currently on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney. I’m sorry to say me and my group have experienced they worse service due to a overly aggressive flight attendant.. I don’t want to believe she racist. But she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour. @Qantas Your #RacistFlightattendant was beyond rude &amp; took it to the next level by calling the police on me. thank god the other passengers testified that SHE was out of Control 🙏🏿 the police finally let me go. imagine if the police were as aggressive as Lorraine Marshall</i>.” Stay tuned for more details in this situation. </p>
