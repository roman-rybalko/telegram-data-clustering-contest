      <h1>PSA: Unable to connect to Disney+? It’s not just you, it’s them… [U: Tweet]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:18:06+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benlovejoy/" target="_blank">Ben Lovejoy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/disney-app-now-available-to-download-on-iphone-ipad-and-apple-tv/">Disney+ launched slightly early today</a>, the iOS and Android apps giving access ahead of the official launch at 3 am ET – but some subscribers have found themselves seeing an ‘Unable to connect to Disney+’ message.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Update: Disney has acknowledged the issue in a tweet, below …</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20960956/disney-plus-unable-to-connect-error-streaming"><i>The Verge</i></a> reports on the Disney+ error message.</p>
      <blockquote>The launch day crunch is causing some problems for Disney+. After going live in the wee hours of the morning, Disney’s streaming service is now showing “unable to connect” errors as customers on the east coast begin waking up, signing up for their free trial, and exploring the Disney+ catalog.<br/><br/>Not everyone seems to be running into the errors, but reports are spiking across Twitter and other social media this morning.</blockquote>
      <p>The Disney+ Help account has now acknowledged the issue on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Disney managed expectations last week, by acknowledging the problems will always occur.</p>
      <blockquote>In preparation for the launch-day US audience, Disney ran a test pilot of Disney+ in The Netherlands. “The Netherlands was a great test. We wanted to have a sufficient number of users so that we could see how the app performed, what technology glitches might exist,” Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer streaming business, said at a media gathering last week. “And by the way, there are always technology glitches. And you can always improve the technical performance of any service like this and we’ll continue to do so. We haven’t solved everything by any means.”</blockquote>
      <p>The Disney+ launch closely follows that of Apple TV+, which currently offers rather limited content.</p>
      <blockquote>Apple TV+ offers original comedies, dramas, thrillers, documentaries, and kids shows. However, unlike most other streaming services, Apple TV+ does not include a back catalog of any kind.</blockquote>

      <p>Disney+, in contrast, offers a massive range of existing content, as well as new shows, as the company recently promoted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1183715553057239040">lengthy Twitter thread</a> collated by <i><a href="https://decider.com/2019/10/14/disney-plus-every-tv-show-movie-launch-day/?_ga=2.35378721.1097778181.1573563510-692651379.1573563510">Decider</a>.</i></p>
