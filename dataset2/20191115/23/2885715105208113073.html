      <p>A youth in his early twenties was booked by the Bodeli police Friday for allegedly kidnapping his own friend and demanding a ransom of Rs 1 crore.</p>
      <p>According to the complaint filed by Dipak Mistry (24), his friend and prime accused in the case Ravi Ahir, repeatedly requested him to meet him on Thursday. When Dipak met Ravi Thursday evening, the accused took him to a secluded place where he was joined by two other unknown men aged between 20 and 25, police said quoting the complaint.</p>
      <p>Dipak alleged that the three gagged him, tied his hands and hit him in his head and hands with a rock. The accused then allegedly snatched his mobile phone and told him that they had been given Rs 70 lakh to kill him and if he wanted to be safe he should ask his father to pay Rs 1 crore, police said. They allegedly forced Dipak to dial his father and asked him for the ransom, the victim alleged in his complaint. The accused also asked his father to drop the money in his Innova car near a dilapidated house in Kosindra village, Dipak alleged.</p>
      <p>The accused then allegedly took Dipak to another secluded place close to Kosindra village, thrashed him again and left the place. Dipak told the police that he somehow managed to walk to the main road, where two passersby offered him help. They also took him to a hospital where he is undergoing treatment, Dipak told the police. His condition is reportedly stable.</p>
      <p>Dipak’s father told the police that he could only manage Rs 1.5 lakh which he had left in the car. The police Tuesday recovered the car from an isolated area in Sankheda, 22 km from where Dipak’s father had dropped it.</p>
      <p>The accused have been booked under IPC sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (2) (punishment for criminal intimidation), 114 (abettor present). No arrests have been made yet.</p>
      <p>“We are yet to make any arrests. We have recovered the car but the accused are on the run with the money. The two other accused have not been identified yet. We are trying to trace them,” said investigating officer CD Patel.</p>
