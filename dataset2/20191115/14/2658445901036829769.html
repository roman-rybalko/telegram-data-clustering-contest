      <p>A civil society group, the Conscience for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution (CHRCR), has urged political parties, their candidates and supporters in the Kogi State governorship elections to desist from making inflammatory and unguided statements that could trigger violence during and after the election in the state.</p>
      <p>Executive Director of the group, Idris Miliki Abdul, in a statement made available to The Nation in Lokoja on Friday said the election was not a war.</p>
      <p>“There will always be life after elections, vote not fight, as election no bi war!Don’t kill your brothers and sister because of this election and don’t allow yourself to be killed because of politicians. We must work for peaceful elections so that we can have peace in our society. Work for justice for you not to be a victim of injustice,” he said.</p>
      <p>Abdul called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to live up to its constitutional responsibilities by creating a level playing field for all stakeholders in this election and live above board.</p>
