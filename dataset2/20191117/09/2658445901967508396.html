        <i>A foolish man prefers licking the crumbs from the table of the rich more than breaking bread in the house of his brother…</i>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>We ended the first segment on this topic asserting the ADOS (American Descendants of Slavery) reparations movement in the United States is guided by advocates sincere in their concern for African Americas in the United States. They are not false agents deliberately trying to lead people astray. However, their sincerity might be the greatest danger. They seem to be blind to the deeper implications of the narrow course they chosen.</p>
      <p>The architects of this movement underestimate the extent that hand of the American government, from the period of slavery to the present, has stricken much of the world. They seem woefully uninformed even nonchalant about the deprivations slavery and colonialism visited on the African continent.  Such ignorance is strange indeed for people professing to advance the cause of blacks in America. Because of their closed-minded, ahistorical perspective they endanger wider black unity in a manner that undermines the moral basis and the political force of the reparation claims they set forth.</p>
      <p>In a way, ADOS leaders are more traditionally American in their mindset than they would care to admit. Much like their white counterparts, they see the world as stage on which America does as it pleases. Other countries and peoples can be tossed and battered; their resources and money confiscated; their societies gutted. No real harm done because anything that profits powerful elements in America is for the greater good. All wrongs committed the name of America become right because the nation’s political, military and economic power justifies all.  To stand in the way of the American government is to be chastised by Fate itself.</p>
      <p>It is unfortunate that ADOS leaders should assent to such unfeeling hubris.  They should know better. For it was precisely this viewpoint that led to the enslavement of their ancestors. Progressive black Americans of the 1960s would have called such a viewpoint misguided, even reactionary. Dr. King would not have understood it. Malcolm X would have turned his back to it. Fifty years later, these ADOS leaders claim to be of the lineage of Malcolm and King. They are mistaken.</p>
      <p>They seek to take the lead of a movement without the requisite comprehensive understanding of the economic history of slavery and of the rapacity of the American empire.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the passage of the last half century and the demographic changes that accompanied this passage of time has removed the fear that America might return to the old days of stark racial segregation. Shorn of such mortal fears, ADOS leaders see no compelling reason to ally with black Africa or the black diaspora. Sensing the worst of American racism now lies in the past, their desire to reform the unequal and unjust way America operates internally or toward the outside world has been blunted. They basically are fine with how America conducts its business, with how it does what it does to other nations and peoples.  Their gripe can be distilled to one jolting thought. And that thought is not justice or even its proximate neighbor. They simply want their cut of the take; they desire what they see as their overdue share of the booty no matter how ill-gotten it may be.</p>
      <p>The American people are basically decent and good. However, the American government has for decades been run by the corps of the merciless in league with the concert of sociopaths. If you are a black leader who speaks too loudly about freedom and sovereignty over their land and their own minds, you destined for grisly, incarnadine end. The authorities never searched for those who killed Malcolm x. They did not search because they knew the assassins; they likely armed and gave the killers a little stipend from the security state to carry out the sordid deed. We still can’t place a fitting stone over Patrice Lumumba’s grave because his murderers never told us where his mutilated body was discarded.</p>
      <p>Iraq and Libya told the world they would not use the dollar. Their economies were torched; for such heresy, their leaders were executed in ways befitting a medieval inquisition. The bombs America dropped in Libya levelled the ground so that nation’s capital could operate as an open air slave markets where the children of black Africa could be sold to people and parts unknown. America did this to fellow black people yet ADOS leaders clamor not to such evils.  Instead, they position themselves to ensure they partake of the illicit profits made possible by America’s carnassial foreign policy.</p>
      <p>The American government has stolen billions of dollars in resources and money from nations for no other reason than Washington disapproving the independent cut of the nations’ leaders. From Venezuela, America has taken oil and dollars to bring that nation to its knees. Forget the images seen on television of mainly of white anti-government protestors along he boulevards of Caracas, most Venezuelans are back and brown people.  Most would rather have the current government than languish under the one American seeks to impose.</p>
      <p>ADOS leaders would seemingly share in the illegal spoils taken from Venezuela (if such was used to pay reparations) without flinching or caring that they were abetting the destruction of black lives in the sanctioned nation.</p>
      <p>Last week I spoke of Haiti and will do so again for it is a most egregious case of injustice. America has basically selected the past three Haitian presidents. These agents have not placed a foot on the path of progress because they were too busy digging their heels into the neck of their people. America’s long standing policy has been to keep Haiti reduced, to prevent it from realizing its better self. 10 billion dollars was                    placed under the custody of former president Clinton to lead relief efforts after the                         ruinous earthquake in Haiti. People are still squatting in the makeshift shelters erected in the first weeks after the quake. The money is missing. Clinton has walked away from Haiti. The people cry and die. No one cares. It is as if they are non-people.</p>
      <p>Haiti could do better but America prohibits that nation from developing its oil reserves.  America also has blocked the vital fuel aid Venezuela was giving Haiti. ADOS members want to extract reparations from the same government that chokes Haiti without mercy. However, ADOS sees no moral or brotherly ties to Haitians; nor does it feel an obligation to fight its potential paymaster in Washington to repair the damage wrought against the once heroic, now destitute black republic. The harm America has inflicted on Haiti is mirrored by the evil America has visited against black populations in Cuba and throughout the Americas.</p>
      <p>Yet, in the eyes of ADOS, America’s racial unfairness ends at the American border.  What it does to blacks elsewhere is inconsequential. Their very self-identification is a paradox. In effect their position is that they are black within the context of the United States. But in the international context, their prime identity is American.  Seeking to be treated as a separate and unique nationality, they are out of Africa but in no way of or for Africa. Any connection to Africa is historical. In the realm of politics and economics, they see other blacks as just another ethnic group. As such, ADOS members remain galley workers and deck hands on the American ship of state.</p>
      <p>During the 1960s, black American leaders championed African liberation. They hated colonialism, seeing it as the sibling of American slavery and its subsequent system of legalized racial discrimination. They lobbied and protested for America to remove its mean hand from Africa’s throat. These people perfectly understood that black America’s troubles and black Africa’s were spun on the same weave and consisted of much the same thread. To correctly fight one meant that you must simultaneously fight both.</p>
      <p>The passage of time has fogged the black American and African minds. Few black Americans reach out to Africa. Few Africans reach out to black America. Both sides are wrong in this omission. Both are and will continue to pay a heavy price for their lack of racial foresight and vigilance.</p>
      <p>This is the most glaring lapse in the ADOS movement. ADOS adherents are willing to accept America as an international leviathan committing all manner of transgressions against weaker nations. Yet they expect the same government to treat them justly at home. They seem not to comprehend that domestic injustice is born of the same stuff as imperialism abroad. No man is a swindler on the streets and an honest man at home. The two cannot magically delink. A nation that straitjackets weaker nations must also inhibit domestic minorities. This is the inevitable, relentless dynamic of racial prejudice. If blackness in Africa will be pinioned to the floor, blackness in America also must be stunted. National borders can no more lactify blackness than can the clouds above turn into the colors on a nation’s flag when the clouds pass from over one nation to the next.</p>
      <p>Visit the ADOS website you will encounter a section on how to pay for reparations. Let’s assume for the moment America becomes willing to pay reparations. The claims approximate 10 trillion dollars or more. I have little qualm with that except to say that it is too low. However, this amount represents “back pay” covering a span of many decades. To obtain a lump sum payment or payment over even a five year period, the aggregate sum will have to be largely discounted to roughly 20-30 percent, i.e. 2-3 trillion dollars</p>
      <p>There are roughly 30 million black Americans. This is roughly 70,000-100,000 dollars per each. This will help but not for as long or as much as it might seem at first face. For example, a family of four would obtain 400,000 dollars. Suppose the family was a working class one with a very modest income. Chances are the family currently lives in rented space. The family has little savings and few assets. If they live in or near a large city, their reparations amount barely pays the cost of an average home. They also may need a car, home appliances, and furniture not to speak of medical insurance or tertiary education for the children.</p>

      <p>People will soon discover there are two aspects to prosperity. We all know the one about the present possession of money. Equally important but less apparent is the ability to continue to achieve a certain level of income. In this regard, a lump sum payment is akin to winning a small lottery.  The award is beneficial but also easily expended in relatively short order. Now the family has the desired home. All seems well. However, if the family does not earn sufficient income subsequent to the reparations award, they may be unable to pay real estate taxes or otherwise maintain home ownership.</p>
      <p>Without attempting to fix the inequities in black employment and income, the lump sum reparations payment will be a burden in disguise for many blacks. They will venture into an inflated housing market by spending all or the majority of their award. However, their meager incomes may not be sufficient to sustain their enhanced lifestyle over time. An economic down turn may wipe away many of them, repeating what the 2009 financial crisis did to black homeownership.</p>
      <p>Unless the nation tackles the problem of black income and employment, the lump sum payments will bring historic booms to the housing and perhaps auto industries. The economic improvements of many blacks will prove transitory. Much more needs to be done to reform the highly financialized, acutely unequal economy in order to protect and optimize the sustainability of any reparations award.  If this not done, the material evidence of the awards will disappear for half the recipients within a generation.</p>
      <p>Ask ADOS why not limit liability for reparations to the descendants of those who owned slaves. After all, most whites did not own slaves. Those whites will say they should not have to pay for the wrongs of others. ADOS will cry against that. ADOS will assert that slavery was a national phenomenon in need of a bespoken national remedy. Thus, the nation must pay. Such a reply is right but woefully incomplete. A more accurate portrait would cast slavery as the initial fulcrum of the era of industrialization and globalization that began in the 18th century. As such, the enslaved blacks who were victimized by America were not solely confined to America’s shores.</p>
      <p>Someone who knowingly invests in or purchases the goods of modern-day firm that employs slave labor is not absolved from blame simply because the enslaved labor is put to the task and to the lash in a different nation. Likewise, America’s abuse of Africans has a decidedly international aspect. However, ADOS opposes this wider scope of liability for the American nation.</p>
      <p>There is a cynical logic underlying the superficial inconsistency of the ADOS position that reparation liability should not be limited to descendants of slaveholding families yet also should not be expanded to encompass descendants of slaves in other nations. ADOS has conjured its formulation regarding liability for payment and eligibility for award not based on optimal justice or logic. Their crafty formulation is but a means of seeking the highest award for the group of blacks to which they belong. They do this even at the expense of leaving undressed the gross injustice America has done and continues to visit on blacks elsewhere.</p>

        <b>Reparations: Another schism in the black race (2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADOS behaves ignobly in this regard. In effect, they toss in their lot with white power simply because that is where the most money and material benefit seems to lie. For black America geography means a certain inescapable level of attachment to the mainstream political economy. However, ADOS takes this a step too far backward. By pasting themselves to the hip of white America to achieve economic reward while eschewing strong cooperation with blacks elsewhere is not brave nor is it as progressive and as forward leaning as ADOS pretends.  This conduct is the modern-day equivalent of the house slave identifying more with the financial wellbeing and economic fortunes of the master than the plight of those blacks in the distant fields. In this case, the mansion is America. The faraway fields are the nations of Africa and Caribbean.</p>
      <p>There is more than a troublesome hint of black self-hatred in all of this. The ADOS website even goes so far as to suggest that upon paying reparations the United States government could seek partial indemnification from African nations that participated in the slave trade! This reveals a stunning lack of knowledge. First, the African nations that now exist did not exist in anything near their current form during the transatlantic slave trade. These nations cannot be held liable for any such thing? Second, black Africans generally fought or fled the white slavers. Kingdoms and peoples were decimated and collapsed due to this invasion.   Most Africans that traded slaves did so under duress – either they gave up others or they would have been forced to give over themselves to the slavers. Those Africans who partook of slaving for the perverse excitement and profit to be made were few indeed. But he cardinal point ADOS misses is that slavery crippled Africa; it did not enrich it.</p>
      <p>To even suggest that Africa should pay the American government for a slavery that enriched America but impoverished Africa is an odd proposition. Strangely, ADOS does not suggest America seeking indemnity from the true slave-trading nations of UK, France, Portugal or Spain.  If not for these nations and their vessels, black slaves would not have been trafficked in great numbers to the New World.  If you remove the African slavers from the equation, the Europeans would still have managed to jam-pack the holds of their ships with the shackled bodies of stolen black men, women and children.</p>
      <p>I fear ADOS leaders may have had personal encounters with individual Africans that were less than satisfying. If so, they do a disservice to a great cause by elevating their individual pique to the level of policy and intra-racial discord.</p>
      <p>Their stance is also bad politics. Most white Americans will never actively support black reparations. They fear it will lessen them. Reparations remains a minority position despite its enhanced visibility. On the domestic political front, black America’s most natural political allies in this are communities of black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean. However, if ADOS excludes them and even claims some of them are liable, ADOS has turned friend and brother into political foe. ADOS seeks reparations but what it creates are fissures among black people that serve no one save those who would keep blacks low.</p>
      <p>Better had ADOS claimed that black Americans are entitled to direct or national reparations while black Africa, for example, is due indirect or international reparations. Under the principle of first do no harm, such indirect reparations could include America forswearing unilateral military intervention on the continent. Also America could establish an infrastructure and industrialization fund that will spend 30 billion dollars in Africa yearly for 25 years. Half of the monies would be earmarked for firms owned by Africans or black Americans. This would help America have a more positive stance in Africa thus counterbalancing China’s role. This would also help Africa by providing more funds while lessening its dependency on China for such funds. It also would spur black business development on two continents.</p>
      <p>In the end, reparations are due. But they are due to blacks in the Americas and black Africans alike. ADOS wrongs us by exacerbating intra-racial divisions instead of healing them. Black people should use this moment to redefine themselves by rekindling the spirit of cooperation that described the relationship between black America and Africa during the contemporaneous movements of civil rights in America and independence in Africa.  Otherwise, ADOS will not be a path to reparations in the fullest meaning of the term.  It will degenerate into a vehicle that foments resentment and one that leads all but a few of us toward a more discreet form of servitude.</p>
