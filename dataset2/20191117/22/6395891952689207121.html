      <p><b>BALTIMORE (AP)</b> - Deshaun Watson couldn't run, couldn't hide and couldn't escape from the Baltimore Ravens' defense.</p>
      <p>Making matters worse for the Houston Texans: They couldn't handle the elusive and talented Lamar Jackson.</p>
      <p>Jackson threw four touchdown passes and ran for 86 yards to help Baltimore extend its winning streak to six games with a 41-7 rout of the Texans on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The game was billed as a matchup between first-place AFC teams and two of the best double-threat quarterbacks in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Jackson and the Baltimore defense made it a one-sided affair, and now the Ravens (8-2) are riding their longest winning streak since a seven-game run in 2000, their first Super Bowl season.</p>
      <p>"Anytime you are 8-2 you have a special group of guys," said running back Mark Ingram, who caught two TD passes. "We have a goal of being champions."</p>
      <p>After throwing three touchdown passes to put Baltimore up 21-0 in the third quarter, Jackson followed with his most impressive play of the day: a 39-yard run in which he broke six tackles, weaving through the Houston secondary as if playing keep-away with the football.</p>
      <p>Though Jackson didn't get into the end zone, the jaunt had a striking resemblance to his dazzling 47-yard touchdown run against the Bengals one week earlier.</p>
      <p>"That was remarkable. It was incredible," coach John Harbaugh said of Jackson's downfield foray against Houston. "I haven't seen anything quite like it - since last week."</p>
      <p>Ingram said: "He keeps one-upping himself."</p>
      <p>Watson, on the other hand, spent the entire afternoon running from a defense that utilized a variety of blitzes and coverages. Baltimore rang up seven sacks - six against Watson - forced two turnovers and limited the nimble-footed quarterback to 12 yards rushing on three carries.</p>
      <p>"To control Deshaun Watson the way they did was a team effort," Harbaugh said. "Great job of good, disciplined rush lanes."</p>
      <p>Watson went 18 for 29 for 169 yards with a lost fumble and an interception. Houston (6-4) fell behind 34-0 before Carlos Hyde ran for a 41-yard touchdown with 7:10 remaining.</p>
      <p>Jackson remained on the sideline after that. With Robert Griffin III taking the snaps, Gus Edwards scored on a 63-yard run with 4:10 left.</p>
      <p>And with that, Watson was removed from the game, too.</p>
      <p>"It didn't go our way. They executed, we didn't execute. That's it," Watson said.</p>
      <p>So what's next?</p>
      <p>"Flush it and move forward," Watson said, matter-of-factly.</p>
      <p>Jackson completed 17 of 24 passes for 222 yards. After starting 1 for 6, he completed 13 in a row to turn the game into a rout.</p>
      <p>Jackson is the first Ravens player to have two games in a season with at least four touchdown passes. He had five in the opener against Miami.</p>
      <p>"I like that stat. I'd rather throw them than run them," Jackson said.</p>
      <p>Ingram caught touchdown passes of 25 and 12 yards in the second half after Seth Roberts and Mark Andrews scored before halftime.</p>
      <p>For the season, Jackson has 19 TD passes, five interceptions and a whopping 788 yards rushing.</p>
      <p>Houston came in with four wins in five games before last week's bye. The extra rest obviously was of no use in preparing for a strong Ravens team that defeated Seattle and New England during this impressive winning streak.</p>
      <p>The Texans failed to score in the first half for the first time this season, generating only 102 yards of offense and yielding four sacks while falling behind 14-0.</p>
      <p>Watson lost a fumble on Houston's opening drive, but Baltimore's Justin Tucker subsequently hit the right upright with a 43-yard field goal try. It was his first miss in 23 attempts dating to last season.</p>
      <p>Later in the quarter, the Ravens were denied a first down on a fake field goal.</p>
      <p>Jackson found his groove on Baltimore's third possession, throwing for 50 yards and running for 12 during a 90-yard march that ended with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Roberts.</p>
      <p>For an encore, Jackson threw an 18-yard scoring strike to Andrews to cap a 70-yard drive and make it 14-0 with 2:14 left in the first half.</p>
      <p>"We didn't start well offensively and it gave (Jackson) time," O'Brien said. "We didn't adjust. Once he got going, he got going."</p>
      <p>MR. 600</p>
      <p>With four catches in the first quarter, the 27-year-old Hopkins became the second-youngest player in NFL history to reach 600 receptions for his career. Only Larry Fitzgerald was quicker to 600.</p>
      <p>INJURIES</p>
      <p>Texans: S Mike Adams received a concussion during pregame warmups and did not play. ... CB Lonnie Johnson Jr. hurt his right foot during Jackson's 39-yard jaunt. ... S Justin Reed left in the third quarter with a shoulder injury. ... WR Will Fuller (hamstring) was inactive.</p>
      <p>Ravens: DT Michael Pierce (ankle) was inactive.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Houston makes a quick turnaround, hosting Indianapolis on Thursday night in a key AFC South matchup.</p>
      <p>Baltimore travels across the country to face the Los Angeles Rams on Monday night.</p>
