      </p>
      <p>I don’t know if what I am about to say constitutes hate speech, but honestly I must say it: I am not full of love for our political organisations and even practitioners right now. There! I’ve said it. Is that hate speech? Dunno and don’t care. Obviously, I do not need to tell you that I don’t belong to any political party. Oh yes, I’ve said that before. As a matter of fact, I am at a loss to guess what our senate could be thinking of dreaming up a bill that seeks to kill their ‘fellow Nigerians’ merely for making a hate speech or spreading falsehood?</p>
      <p>There I was, thinking that Nigerians had lost their capability to process shocking news, and they go and prove me wrong. Just look at it. Nearly every corner you turn, shocking news accost one: the economy is bad; there are no jobs; the country is living on borrowed funds … It is an endless stream, is it not? Yet, Nigerians receive tonnes of its kind daily without moving a muscle.</p>
      <p>This once, however, Nigerians acted surprised and right. The announcement that there exists a bill seeking the death penalty for hate speech threw a pebble to roil the otherwise calm surface of the endurance existence of Nigerians and brought out something resembling their red eye. I mean, we are in a democracy, for goodness’ sakes! Or does that not count? The only pivot strong enough to hold the democratic institution is the belief in freedom of speech. This freedom allows ideas to flow so that the country does not rely on only one man’s ideas who may think to have the prerogative to think for the country. In a democracy, everyone’s thinking is needed.</p>
      <p>I’ve also read reports about Nigerians criticising the bill and wondering what it’s all about. Naturally, the party in opposition, the PDP, has also vociferously raised its voice against it and, being the seer it is among other things, insinuated some darker, sinister motives to it. Me, being the fly in the room, I have been watching and sighing.</p>
      <p>There were other reactions. Take the cartoon that suggested that if the death penalty can pass for hate speech, then a stiffer punishment should go for budget padding. Like I said, I am only the fly in the room. The thing about flies is their periscopic vision which allows them to detect movement from any direction. Have you ever wondered why you can scarcely ever catch one unaware? Well, the answer is in their prophetic powers.</p>
      <p>Listen, even I, the innocuous fly on the wall, had to honestly and seriously ponder what our politicians were about, thinking up such a bill. To start with, death penalty for an offence is so grave that in any civilized society, it is not recommended for anything less than the most heinous crime such as clearly proven cases of murder. Secondly, to suggest it in a bill for a crime such as verbal diarrhea is most baffling. It strongly smirks of hatred against the state itself, i.e., the people. It seems to me that some people are harbouring some serious grievances against the people.</p>
      <p>If we’re not living in a tsarist state or a totalitarian society where the instruments of rule include fear and coercion, why the paranoia? Have the people become captured citizens? Have the people become serfs in this fiefdom so that the rulers can make any pronouncements as the fancy takes them whether they mean to carry it out or not?</p>
      <p>As I read the news report on this subject, I honestly became more dismayed with each attempt to explain it off. One explanation said, and I paraphrase, that the bill may not pass into an act in that form as the death penalty may be removed depending on the reaction of Nigerians. My reaction of course was that it should not have been put there in the first place. To have done that was to have treated Nigerians without due respect. Now, you’ll probably say that my tirade counts as hate speech, who knows?</p>
      <p>There are many crimes in Nigeria begging for the death penalty. Let me just count a few for you and you be the judge. When one reads a news report about a sixty-five-year old man raping an infant of two years to death, what judgment do you think befits such a person? So, I ask you, what penalty befits a man who rapes a woman to death for her audacity to talk back to him or to have owed him one thousand, five hundred Naira which actually happened in this country? What penalty befits a single individual who embezzles enough funds to run the affairs of a country of fifty million people for an entire year? What penalty should be given to someone who performs rituals involving the use of human parts knowing from there the parts are sourced? Shall we go on with my questions? I’m rather full of them today.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there are more important things that our national assembly could be concerned about. Each and every day, when I see a child, a woman with a child on her back, or a pregnant woman being ferried on a motorbike, I cringe and weep for my country. They remind me of our callousness, carelessness and lawlessness. There ought to be laws against the ferrying of children or pregnant women on motor bikes. There are taxis which are known to be safer.</p>
      <p>Whenever I pass by our roads, I see people eking out a living cooking by the wayside without any state intervention, I again cringe for my country. Most of such foods are exposed to the germs oozing out of the atmosphere or clogged sewage system black with stuff right behind the cook and with no law to cover such pots. This is why we say that our country men and women are feeding right out of the gutters. At such times. I want to shout to the assembly, ‘we need some laws here, folks!’</p>
      <p>Whenever I have passed by the roadside and I see a mother struggling with a desperately sick child, it is obvious she cannot cope. Many families, dear law makers, are not capable of handling some determinedly grave illnesses, yet there is often no state intervention. This is utterly careless of all of us in this country, especially, those involved in making the laws.</p>
      <p>There is no reason why there should not be a law compelling the state to have a register of all the children who require state intervention in their care, such as autistic children, terminally sick children, children with learning disabilities, etc. The law should include not just caring for them but even funding social workers to monitor their progress. How about it then, our dear law makers? How about enacting laws that will make life more meaningful for such heavily disadvantaged children instead of leaving them to neighbours’ charity instincts?</p>
      <p>Government, to me, means organising the society to harness all our strength to protect the weak and make the strong accountable. It does not mean fighting hate speech, the constitutive of which people are not quite agreed. Honestly, the hate speeches I hear coming from the people at the top in this country – ministers, etc., — are making me so uncomfortable I am beginning to think I need an apology. First, it was against doctors, then our roads, and now, there’s an obnoxious, no-good, hateful, speech bill against the whole country. What will they think of next? Ha, o su mi o!</p>
