      <p>Throughout its history, America has struggled over three competing but interlocking general ideas about its identity and its place in the world. These ideas are, first, America as a white only country; second, America as a majoritarian white country; third, America as a multiracial and multicultural country. In literal or indeed actual terms, America has never been a whites-only country. An indigenous population was there thousands of years before whites arrived in the country and, indeed, it took a nearly successful genocide of that indigenous population for whites to become the dominant racial demographic in the country. And in the course of time, simultaneously as whites from Europe arrived and settled in the country, so did groups from the other continents of the world – Africa, South America, Asia, Australasia. However, European whites always came in greater numbers and, more importantly brought with them ideas, projects and policies of racial superiority and innate will to dominance.</p>
      <p>As these are indisputable and constitutive aspects of American history and identity, they are not the real focus of this piece which, at its core, is a reflection on the ongoing impeachment inquiry into the presidency of Donald Trump, the 45th American president. Trump is being tried in the US House Representatives for abuse and misuse of power: instead of the interests of the country, he is using the enormous powers and authority vested in his office for his own political gain in the forthcoming presidential elections of 2020. In concrete terms, Trump is being tried because through coercion and extortion, he tried to extort the president of Ukraine to provide him with scandal and dirt about Joe Biden who is likely to be his opponent in next year’s presidential election. This is bad enough, especially since America has itself intervened in the elections of many other countries of the world and therefore knows what outrage and humiliation a country feels when another country intervenes in its elections. But what is worse is the fact that in his attempted extortion of Ukraine, Trump and his minions destroyed the careers of many American diplomatic and civil service officials as well as the lives of hundreds of Ukrainians.</p>
      <p>In the American constitutional and political order, you do not need a myriad or a surfeit of crimes and misdemeanors to be charged and tried for impeachment. You do not even need for small or great suffering to have been caused by your crime or misdeed. All that is required is for your misdeed to have crossed the line between legality and impunity and the borderline between the dignity and authority of the presidency and the caprices and arbitrariness of autocracy. In other words, impeachment rests not on the suffering, pain or insecurity a president may have caused but on his proven violations of cardinal principles and norms of the American political and constitutional order.</p>
      <p>Think about this: Bill Clinton, the 42nd president, was impeached because he was deemed to have lied under oath, thereby perjuring himself over alleged  adulterous sexual liaisons with an intern at the White House. Think also about this: with maximum impunity and completely in the open, Donald Trump has used the presidency to promote the business interests of himself and members of his family, most of the time at the expense of American taxpayers. But no serious calls for his impeachment have resulted from these crimes. Indeed, as I wrote in this column three weeks ago, throughout their history, Americans have been extremely reluctant, not only to impeach their presidents, but also to initiate and successfully conclude impeachment proceedings against a sitting president.</p>
      <p>In variety of the observations that I have been making about impeachment in the American political order in this piece, one thing is constant: though of great consequence, impeachment of American presidents do not necessarily have to be based on crimes and misdemeanors that cause great suffering or immense challenges to the peace and stability of the country and its peoples. Let me add the following, although it will never be invoked as a basis for initiating impeachment proceedings against any American president: at different times in the country’s history, American presidents have caused great havoc in the lives of many countries and their populations through intervention in their politics; but no American president has ever faced impeachment inquiries for such acts and it is safe to say that none will ever face that challenge. This observation leads directly to the heart of the present discussion, this being the monstrous crimes and misdeeds of Donald Trump of which we can be sure that he will never face impeachment inquiries. On this point, I return to the opening paragraphs of this piece in which I made general remarks on the identity of America as, not a whites only country, but a white majoritarian country on its way to becoming a truly multiracial and multicultural country.</p>
      <p>There have been many racists and even white supremacists in the White House and, indeed, a lot has been written about them. But in modern times, none has been more militantly white nationalist and racist than Donald Trump. His racism and xenophobia toward non-white peoples are so deep and wide that they cover not only all of the American homeland but the entire planet. In illustration of this observation, permit me to draw attention to one small detail in the case being carefully built up case against Trump in the ongoing impeachment inquiry. This concerns Gordon Sondland, Trump’s Ambassador to the European Union, who is at the heart of the attempted extortion of Ukraine by the American president. Well, it has come out that Sondland, a businessman who donated a million dollars for ceremonies for the inauguration of Trump in 2016, was posted to the European Union mainly because of his well-known belief that American immigration policy should revert back to the previous privilege of European whites over all other races, ethnicities and groups in the world. In other words, Sondland had absolutely no background in diplomacy and little to none in public or civil service. But since one of Trump’s main objectives is to completely remake America, Europe and the world in terms of racial hierarchies, Sondland was his man for the EU ambassadorship.</p>
      <p>This is worth repeating. Trump, through surrogates like Sondland and Stephen Miller, his Senior Adviser on Immigration policy who is a confessed white nationalist of the far-far right, has openly and militantly embraced white nationalism as a project and a policy, he has rekindled racial bigotry as a leading and open mobilizer of political passions in America itself and in the world at large. Apart from demonstrations and marches by neo-Nazis who openly declare Trump to be a mentor and a kindred spirit, mass killings based on race, religion and ethnicity have reappeared all over America. Jewish synagogues have been attacked and cemeteries desecrated. Churches of Black Americans have been firebombed and worshippers in them slaughtered. In plain language, hundreds of non-white Americans have already died and it is likely that more will die – as long as Trump remains president and the movement that his rise to power has sparked grows in outrage and impunity. But these bonfires of racial hatred and destruction are not and will never be the bases of impeachment of Trump. Why not? Because these atrocities and catastrophes are the direct consequences of Trump’s policies and policies can never be invoked as grounds for impeachment, no matter how evil and destructive they may be.</p>
      <p>Think of this, dear reader: Trump has withdrawn America from virtually all the bilateral treaties and obligations to keep the world peaceful, to protect the environment for the future of our human community and to sustain friendship and solidarity among the nations and peoples of the planet. More narrowly, he has made it abundantly clear that he wishes to destroy NATO as an alliance between America and European nations, replacing NATO with a loose alliance of militantly anti-globalist autocracies around the world. Do you know, dear reader, that he is not impeachable for any of these mad and disastrous policies and projects precisely because American presidents can only be impeached for misdeeds and misdemeanors, not for their policies however dire they may be for America and the world? Permit me to express this in concrete terms. Most Americans are frightened, very frightened by Trump’s political friendships and overtures to the likes of Vladimir Putin, The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Kim of North Korea, Erdogan of Turkey, Al Sisi of Egypt, Duterte of the Philippines and Nigel Farage of the U.K. But what can Americans do about their fears and worries concerning these radical far-right and neo-fascist alliances and friendships of Trump in our world? Nothing at all, least of all making them articles of impeachment of Trump.</p>
      <p>I go back to Trump’s virulent racial bigotry and white nationalism. This is the core, the heart and the soul of his presidency, together with the movement of millions fascist zealots that he has brought to life as a sort of fulcrum or lever of American politics at the present time. But there is another side to this story of the unfolding saga of possible or looming race war or conflagration in America. What is this other side? It is this: America of the 21st century is not like America of the 19th and 20th centuries and a sizeable proportion of American whites are as frightened of Trump’s white nationalist policies and agendas as are African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Arab Americans and other ethnic American demographics. As this is absolutely crucial, permit me to make a short elaboration on it.</p>
      <p>White nationalism is a threat to whites who do not only disagree with its ideas, goals and symbols but deeply hate the movement. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. Here is the simple part: for white nationalist zealots, only members of their groups are true whites; any whites who are not white nationalists and zealots are suspect. The more complex reason pertains to the core class component of white nationalists, this being the poorest, least educated and most resentful among whites. In all the historic and most lethal rule of white nationalists – Pre- and post-abolition America; Hitlerite Germany; and apartheid South Africa – white supremacy rested on this alliance between poor whites and upper-class whites. When that alliance breaks down for one reason another, white nationalism and supremacy meets its limits and ends in defeat. In most places, that comes to pass when non-whites show every indication that they will no longer put with any individual, institutional and cultural bastions of racism. This is why, in the long view of unfolding history of America and the contemporary world, white nationalism is a doomed project – regardless of the fact that Trump will never face impeachment for his racism, xenophobia and nationalist anti-globalism.</p>

        <b>Diversity – Outline of a Poeticized Credo</b>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Beyond the primary colours, look to an extravaganza of colours</p>
      <p>Bio meeting diversity in a startling munificence of nature</p>
      <p>Look to surprises of attraction and revulsion, all in your beholder’s eyes</p>
      <p>Knowing that you, the beholder, is also be the beheld</p>
      <p>The sovereignty never coming to rest with anyone, anything</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Beyond the main watersheds look to the hundred thousand tributaries</p>
      <p>The numbers startling the finitude of fixed points effortlessly</p>
      <p>Look, look always to the mosaics if only because they defy your grasp</p>
      <p>And as you look, as you lose your certitude in their perplexing affront</p>
      <p>Be comforted in and by the scintilla of intuitions that creep on you</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Beyond the Babel of tongues native and foreign, first, second, third and nth</p>
      <p>Some in expansive metamorphoses, others transfixed in suspended animation</p>
      <p>Look to chains broken by mother tongues and chains broken through imposed tongues</p>
      <p>Know, compatriot, know that silence can say as much as Amebo volubility</p>
      <p>So, friend, choose your terms, your words with both care and abandon</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Beyond profligate iterations, expressions and manifestations of Being-in-itself</p>
      <p>Saints and sinners, the blessed and the damned, the elect and the excluded</p>
      <p>All accosting you in endless combinations of possibilities and negations</p>
      <p>Look inward and outward, look close and far but not with Medusa’s eye</p>
      <p>Diversity will not fail you, but swear compatriot, that your heart is not made of Stone</p>
      <p> </p>
