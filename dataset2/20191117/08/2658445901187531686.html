          <u>It’s 24th year of Pearl Awards, what is the ideology behind it?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pearl Awards actually seeks to reward corporate excellence in the Nigeria’s capital market. But as a background to that, it has to do with promoting the interest of investors and prospective investors in the Nigerian capital market. At the time the award started 24 years ago, in 1995, not-so-much was known about the capital market, and we realised that there was a gap where acquainted companies were not being recognised based on actual performance. It is using empirical data and we decided to feel this gap, so it focused on developing the growth of the capital market.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Over the years, what have you achieved and what is unique about this year’s award?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As at the time we started these awards, the capital market was seen as elitist market. People had the erroneous impression that before you could invest in the stock exchange, you must have huge source of money to put in the capital market. But Pearl Award contributed in changing this narrative because one of our objectives is actually to engender public awareness about the capital market. So every year, we ensure that we are able to bring to the knowledge of the people – the fact that the capital market is for everybody.</p>
      <p>Again, we put in place what we call the Pearl Awards Annual Public Lecture where we engage with the stakeholders, shareholders and we have the regulators coming to discuss the market and of course this also has engendered public consciousness about the capital market. Beyond that, for companies that have been nominated for the award over the years, we have seen a trajectory that shows that the share prices go on the upward trend after being nominated or winning the awards, so that is a huge plus. Also, this has engendered healthy competitiveness among the companies that are quoted on the stock exchange, both at the sectoral level and at the market excellence level.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>What are the challenges encountered?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The major challenge we faced particularly when we started was on the issue of funding. For a new projector of that nature, we had to get support from regulatory agencies such as the Corporate Affairs Commission, Security and Exchange Commission, Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria and some other bodies. It was tough but we decided to weather the storm. But over the years, we have been able to change that narrative, we have able to be creative in funding the award, we have introduced the publication, ‘The Nigeria Stock Market Annual’ which publishes the criteria, the methodology and facts and figures of how the nominees and winning companies merge on an annual basis and the publication is also publicly presented at the award night event.</p>
      <p>We normally launch this publication and make sales of it to fund the awards and also get support from various institutions and these have continued to keep us going. We are proud that credibility has never been an issue with the awards because right from the outset we were determined not to be just any award. So, in terms of the constitution of the board of governors of the award, we have credible Nigerians who are professionals right from the start of the project.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who are the awardees?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>For Pearl Award, the unique thing is we have the nominees for this year award and the nominees have been announced. We have three main categories of awards which include the main competitive category, special recognition award category, and the honorary award category. So, for the main competitive award category as well as the special recognition award category, the nominees have been released. They were released on the 22nd of October, 2019. This year’s awards will hold on the 24th of November at Eko Hotel and Signature, Lagos.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>What are the criteria in selecting the nominees?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The award is based on the actual performance of quoted companies. We have nine clearly defined indices for the main competitive category, in line with global best practices to reward corporate excellence and performance in the Nigerian Stock Exchange. These include turn-over growth, returns, and equity, net and set ratio, profit margin ratio, dividend cover, dividend yield, dividend growth and share price appreciation and others.</p>
      <p>And we also have the post listing requirements in the stock exchange because for a company to be considered for this award, the company must have complied with the post listing requirements of the stock exchange. Beyond that, for the sectoral leadership awards, we have a minimum of three companies that must have complied with these requirements and also filed their annual reports with the Nigerian Stock Exchange and also been seen to practice good corporate governance. So, for this year’s sectoral leadership award, we have 17 Sectoral Leadership Award categories.</p>
      <p>We also have the research and collation committee of the Central Working Committee of the award which analyses the performance of these companies using their Annual Financial Reports as presented at the annual general meetings and also the Nigerian Stock Exchange yearly reports and the daily official list. So we crunch all the figures and then we are using the defined parameters to be able to have the first lead for each of the 17 sectors. And for the Market Excellence Awards categories, all the equities listed for the Stock Exchange is assessed utilising each of those nine criteria.</p>

          <u>Tell us about your educational background and growing up</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I studied Accounting in the university and I qualified as a Charted Accountant in 1989 and I became a fellow in 2003.</p>
      <p>But the interesting thing about my primary education is that I attended about seven primary schools and it is because my father was a police officer. He was always transferred from one place to the other and of course, I was changing schools but the good news is that I never repeated a class.</p>
      <p>My working life started in banking that was from 1982 to 1992 (10 years). I was a pioneer management staff of then Eko International Bank now a part of Polaris Bank. I opened the first branch of the bank at Ikeja Plaza located in Ikeja roundabout which still exists till date. I actually planned to spend just ten years in the banking industry and on January 3rd, 1992, I submitted my resignation to establish a company called Trustworth Finance and Investment Limited, but unfortunately, the company went down.</p>
      <p>Also there was a boom at a time and then a blast of finances. It was after that I also had terrible experience that I lost everything I had. To be precise in 1993, I lost about 2.475 million naira in a day and you can imagine what the value of that will be today especially if you look the rate of dollar to naira and the time value of money.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>What actually led to the loss?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I was duped because the company was into importation then that I had to start all over again with a loan of 50 thousand naira. So, I attended many programmes and also delivered lectures and presentations all over the world because I didn’t want to go back into banking.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>What has been your motivation?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I have always believed that success is a function of ensuring that you put smiles on the faces of the greatest number of people, and for me leadership is everything because everything rises and falls on leadership. This is part of the reason we introduced CITC Leadership Centre in our organisation in order to add values to lives.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>What advice do you have for the federal government on the closure of borders across the nation?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, I won’t say I’m fully in support of border closure but I strongly believe that there is always going to be initial pain and without pains, there would be no gains. So we need to focus on self-sufficiency and since the closure, a number of gains are being made currently in terms of revenues and security. If you observed that since the border closure cases of kidnappings and other crimes have reduced. Not only that, you see that our neighbouring countries are actually crying more than us, including Ghana and even Benin Republic.</p>
      <p>So, the pains will be there but government also needs to put in place clearly defined initiatives that would ensure self-sufficiency and optimise the gain derived. Recall that China closed their border for about 40 years but they put in place adequate resources to ensure that their people were able to be self-sufficient.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who are your mentors?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I have quite a number of mentors. These are people I read their books. I believe in the power of reading books. Zig Ziglar, who is the author of a book, ‘CEO at the Top’, is of those that are after my heart. I also appreciate the author of ‘Tough Times Never Last’, Robert Harold Schuller, also Pastor Sam Adeyemi of DayStar Christian Centre and Otunba Subomi Balogun. But my most important mentor is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>What defines your fashion?</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>For me, I like to dress very well, convenient and of course occasion determines my dressings. So if it’s corporate, I like to be corporate and if it’s social, I like to be social.</p>
