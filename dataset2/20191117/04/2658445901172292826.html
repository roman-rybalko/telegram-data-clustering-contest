      </p>
      <p>The battle line has been drawn in the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress as Governor Godwin Obaseki entered the final lap of his first four years in office. Obaseki will be seeking a re-election to the plum office by next year based on what he has achieved but some APC members have vowed to stop him. His opponents used his third year anniversary to fully unveil themselves even though he had earlier fished them out as fifth columnists within his administration.</p>
      <p>It is a battle between the ‘Tor gba’ or ‘Egba’ groups in the Edo APC. It is common to hear in APC political circles that ‘To gba N’ Obaseki or ‘Egba N’ Obaseki. Tor gba means ‘It must Complete,’ while ‘Egba’ means ‘It will not complete’. Thus, a widening gulf has been created within the ranks of Edo APC based on the divide they find themselves.</p>
      <p>Those in the ‘Egba’ group have formed the Edo Peoples Movement. They are known for wearing insignia bearing 3+1 which means Obaseki has only four years in office while the ‘To’ Gba’ is the 4+4 team now under the auspices of Obaseki Shaibu Movement (OSM).</p>
      <p>It was therefore shouts of 4+4 or 3+1 that characterized the first convocation ceremony of the Edo University, Iyamho, which later culminated to the recent attack of Governor Godwin Obaseki and Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu, at the residence of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.</p>
      <p>Management of the Edo University, Iyamho, had planned a well packaged convocation ceremony being its first since the university was established. It was designed to showcase potentials of the institution to visitors and guests with a view to attracting more students’ population.</p>
      <p>Trouble first started on Friday when the Governor of Central Bank, Godwin Emiefele, delivered the convocation lecture. The lecture hall was said to be filled with guests but most of them were 3+1 advocates. A source said it was the sight of political opponents that prompted the mobilisation of 4+4 ‘missionaries’ to the venue.</p>
      <p>It was therefore a large crowd shouting 4+4 that welcomed Obaseki and his entourage to the arena. When former Governor Adams Oshiomhole landed with helicopter, shouts of 4+4 also welcomed him. There were also shouts of 3+1 but they were dwarfed by those of the 4+4.</p>
      <p>During the duration of Emiefele’s lecture, the applaud he got was 4+4 or 3+1. Oshiomhole had to ‘sneak’ away from the event immediately after it ended.</p>
      <p>So, on Saturday, the day of the convocation ceremony, it was a contestation between the 4+4 and 3+1 supporters. Events at the convocation after Oshiomhole and Obaseki spoke suggested a peace move might have occurred but the reverse was the case. Oshiomhole had praised his successor for sustaining his development legacies at the Edo University Iyamho, as the institution is positioned to become a world-class ivory tower. He urged the people to stand and applaud Obaseki. Governor Obaseki also urged the people to thank Oshiomhole for having a vision of development.</p>
      <p>Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu and the Otaru of Auchi, who were present at the occasion, spoke on the need for peace. The hope for peace talks, superintended by the Oba Akiolu, was dashed when Obaseki, the Oba of Lagos and other guests were attacked at the Iyamho residence of Oshiomhole by suspected thugs.</p>
      <p>For those in the 3+1 (EPM) and convened by Henry Idahagbon, Thomas Okosun and Samson Osagie, the move to stop Obaseki from getting a second term in office and to also reposition the Edo APC is a task that must be accomplished. The EPM is a gathering of APC members who are aggrieved with Governor Obaseki for several reasons. There are those aggrieved for not getting appointment after working ‘hard’ to sell Obaseki to the electorates. Some are aggrieved because they were sacked from collecting revenue for the state and local government while former political appointees of Oshiomhole wanted to be reappointed by Obaseki. Many of the EPM members are now regarded as ‘Edo-Abuja’ based politicians.</p>
      <p>Initially, the EPM listed the sins of Obaseki to include lack of continuity of Oshiomhole’s projects like the Benin Storm Water design, closure of some colleges of education, lack of political patronage, abandonment of political leaders. When the House of Assembly crisis surfaced, the EPM included non- swearing-in of all the 24 lawmakers.</p>
      <p>Checks showed that work has since commenced on the Benin Storm Water design and at the new College of Agriculture, Iguoriakhi. All the colleges of education are to be one school with three different campuses and each having its area of specialty.</p>
      <p>In a bid to take control of the Edo APC structure, it was gathered that the EPM moved to unseat the state chairman of the party, Anselm Ojezua, on the day Obaseki would be marking his third year anniversary in office. The plot was blown open on Sunday night when the state auditor of the Edo APC, Timothy Osadolor, returned the N1m he was given to sign the vote of no confidence notice against Ojezua.</p>
      <p>Ojezua quickly convened an emergency meeting and it was discovered that 11 members of the State Working Committee had signed the letter. Besides Osadolor, the State Youth Leader, Valentine Asuen, the Financial Secretary, Princess Golda Oribhabor-Onwuka and three others reported how they were forcefully taken to the residence of the suspended Secretary of the party, Lawrence Okah, to sign the notice. Okah was suspended last month at an emergency meeting of the State Executive Committee to allow the committee set up to investigate allegations against him from his local government.</p>
      <p>Osadolor, who distanced himself from the document, purporting to remove Ojezua from office, said they were taken in a commando style to the residence of Okah where they were forced to sign the document. Giving details of the incident, the auditor explained that they were invited by a colleague for a meeting from where they were whisked to Okah’s residence.</p>
      <p>Osadolor said he was threatened and asked to sign the document if he wanted to leave the residence alive.</p>
      <p>He stated that he had to append a fake signature against his name to regain freedom.</p>
      <p>According to him, “What happened, to the best of my knowledge, is an act of desperation taken too far. We were taken in a commando style to the house of the state secretary, where I was forced to sign the documents purportedly removing Anslem Ojezua. There were just eight or nine signatures on the document. My name was badly spelt. I didn’t draw their attention to it but had to play along by signing the document with a fake signature.</p>
      <p>Ojezua quickly mobilised and secured the support of 15 out of 18 local government party chairmen. Briefing newsmen after the meeting of the party’s State Executive Committee, the Deputy State Chairman of Edo APC, Engr. Kenneth Asekomhe, said, “After the meeting of the State Executive Committee, in pursuant of Article 17, Section 5 of APC Constitution of 2014, as amended, we, the undersigned members, passed a vote of no confidence on the State Secretary of the party, Mr. Lawrence Okah. He is hereby removed from office.”</p>
      <p>“The committee also passed a vote of confidence on the State Chairman of APC, Mr. Anselm Ojezua.”</p>
      <p>At a meeting, the 15 APC local government chairmen reaffirmed their support for the second term bid of Governor Godwin Obaseki on account of his developmental strides and after the meeting, a vote of no confidence was passed on the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.</p>
      <p>APC Chairman in Esan Central LGA and Secretary, Edo State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon. Mike Anakaso, said the chairmen passed a vote of no confidence on Oshiomhole for his role in trying to disintegrate the party in Edo State.</p>
      <p>He said, “Comrade Adams Oshiomhole is the one behind the crisis in Edo APC and we have passed a vote of no confidence on him. We don’t want what happened in Zamfara or other parts of the country to happen in Edo State.”</p>
      <p>The EPM responded by suspending Governor Obaseki, his Deputy, Philip Shaibu and SSG, Osarodion Ogie for alleged anti-party activities. Patrick Ikhariale, who briefed journalists in Benin City after a meeting at the residence of a governorship aspirant, Major-General Charles Airhiavbere (rtd), alleged that Obaseki agreed to pay the sum of N6bn to defect to the PDP and secure the party’s ticket.</p>
      <p>Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Wednesday opened up on how disappointed he was with recent political events in the state.</p>
      <p>Obaseki said he and the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, once shared a common interest to salvaging Edo State. He stated that the political disruption from a once-trusted leader who has thrown caution to the wind to cause disaffection among APC members in the state was disappointing.</p>
      <p>He also noted that the common interest he shared with Oshiomhole has changed in recent times.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Between Obaseki and Oshiomhole</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Many residents in the state are still wondering what went wrong between Oshiomhole and Obaseki. Oshiomhole once described Obaseki as the engine room, the brainbox, the software and technocrat that made him to succeed as Edo State governor for eight years.  At an enlarged meeting of the Edo APC, Obaseki said he and Oshiomhole once shared a vision to transform Edo State.</p>
      <p>The governor, who expressed disappointment at the turn of political events in the state with the backing of Oshiomhole, said the former governor was not truthful about comments on his administration.</p>
      <p>According to him, “I am not an ungrateful person. No one made me governor. I became governor by God’s grace, with the support of many other people. If God had said I would not be governor, no way would I have been a governor. It is wrong for someone to say he made me governor.</p>
      <p>“No one gave me money. The funds Oshiomhole initially raised for his governorship ambition was raised by me in Lagos. If I can raise money for him for his election, why would I not be able to raise money for my own election?</p>
      <p>“If you came into power on some basic principles, do not expect to change those principles because you have certain ambition. If you came to power believing no man is God, then the day you start to play God, you will get the consequences.”</p>
      <p>There are already fears that what happened in Zamfara, Rivers and Bayelsa where the APC failed or battled to field candidates for elections might resurface in Edo if the warring factions failed to sheath their sword.</p>
      <p>For the 4+4 advocates, it must be Obaseki or nobody for the APC ticket while several aspirants, including incoming Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, are banking on the 3+1 advocates. How the game will eventually play out may depend on the intervention by President Muhammadu Buhari if the APC wants to remain the ruling party in Edo.</p>
