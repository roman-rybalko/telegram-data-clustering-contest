      <p>As the news from the eurozone continues to deteriorate, with the latest prognostications for the German economy looking particularly concerning, Irish economic data releases continue to paint a pretty positive picture of what is happening here.</p>
      <p>The proviso for Ireland, now, is that while the real economic indicators are still generally positive, both consumer and businesss entiment indicators are striking a more cautious note.</p>
      <p>Obviously, the continued uncertainty around Brexit is the key factor driving this caution, but a quick perusal across the world of global geo-politics and economics would also give grounds for caution.</p>
      <p>The obvious hope, here in Ireland, is that the negative sentiment indicators do not translate across into real economic activity.</p>
      <p>To date, that is not happening,except for the new car market, where trading conditions continue to be very challenging.</p>
      <p>If one gauges the success of a government on the health of the labour market, and plenty of people would be prepared to blame the Government for a poor labour market performance, then the current Government is doing a fine job.</p>
      <p>Last year, employment reached the highest level ever recorded in this country, and it has continued to expand since then.</p>
      <p>More tellingly, the number of people unemployed is also continuing to trend strongly downwards.</p>
      <p>In October, the number of people unemployed fell to 117,300, which represents a decline of 239,300 since the highs of 2012.</p>
      <p>The unemployment rate fell to 4.8% of the labour force, down from a high of 16% in 2012.</p>
      <p>This is the lowest level of unemployment recorded since the crash of 2007 and 2008.</p>
      <p>In the early part of the last decade, Ireland was referred to as a “mean, lean, green, job-creating machine”, and this title certainly seems to be apt once again.</p>
      <p>Of course, it is not the role of Government to create employment, but rather to create an environment where entrepreneurs are willing to invest in business and create employment.</p>
      <p>This certainly appears to be working here, and although I have certainly detected a greater level of caution on the part of employers in hiring labour as a result of the paralysis generated by Brexit, there is still pressure to take on extra labour to deal with strong demand conditions.</p>
      <p>The export sector is leading the way in this regard, but the more general picture is also still positive.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there is no greater manifestation of the strength of an economy than what is happening on the tax revenue front.</p>
      <p>For every economic action engaged in, tax must be paid for the privilege of doing so and the more action we engage in, the more tax we pay.</p>
      <p>The latest exchequer returns for the first 10 months of the year show that tax revenue buoyancy is still a feature.</p>
      <p>The exchequer has collected €44.9bn in tax revenues so far this year, which is €2.8bn — or 6.7% — higher than the same period last year and is €706m higher than was budgeted for.</p>
      <p>Corporation tax continues to be the star performer, with €6.9bn collected so far this year, which, in turn, is €660m more than was budgeted for.</p>
      <p>This year looks set to see another record tax take from the corporate sector, but the only question is the sustainability of this expanding tax base.</p>
      <p>Nobody is too sure of the answer, but a cautious approach to spending still seems the most prudent approach to pursue.</p>
      <p>On the Brexit front, the formal commencement of the UK general election campaign has done nothing to dispel the intense uncertainty about the eventual Brexit outcome.</p>
      <p>Many remainers on the Tory side are opting out of politics and letting the door open for hard Brexiteers, which is not good.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Liberal Democrats are polling strongly, but under the UK electoral system, this would be unlikely to translate into an equivalent number of seats.</p>
      <p>One thing that is clear is that the UK prime minister is fighting an election campaign against the background of a much weaker economy, which is always dangerous.</p>
      <p>It is also clear that the economic policy platform of Boris Johnson, including his Brexit policy, is devoid of good sense. The coming weeks promise to be very interesting.</p>
