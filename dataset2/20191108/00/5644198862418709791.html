      <p>The acquisition of companies for their data is concerning in general for regulators, Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday, a week after Google bought fitness trackers company Fitbit.</p>
      <p>LISBON: The acquisition of companies for their data is concerning in general for regulators, Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday, a week after Google bought fitness trackers company Fitbit .</p>
      <p>Alphabet Inc-owned Google paid US$2.1 billion (£1.6 billion) for Fitbit to help it take on Apple and Samsung Electronics in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches.</p>

      <p>Vestager declined to comment on the deal specifically but said there was general unease among regulators when data-heavy companies are the targets of bids.</p>
      <p>Google's deal has triggered calls from competitors to competition enforcers to take a tough line. Fitbit, which helped pioneer the wearable devices craze, has an invaluable trove of health data.</p>
      <p>"In general we have a concern if companies merge because of data," Vestager told a news briefing at Web Summit.</p>
      <p>She added that regulators then considered the questions of, does this create a barrier to entry, will this make it more difficult to innovate and does a risk to privacy issues arise from that kind of data coming together.</p>
      <p>Google's Fitbit deal requires EU regulatory approval.</p>
      <p>Vestager has in the last two years handed down more than 8 billion euros in fines to Google for stifling competitors in three separate cases involving its price comparison shopping product, its Android smartphone operating system and in search advertising brokering.</p>
