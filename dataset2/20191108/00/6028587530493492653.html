      <h1>Turning Adversities Into Inspiration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Oscar L. McClain</a></address>
      <p>I believe that overcoming obstacles in life is what makes success  worth achieving. It’s like former First Lady Michelle Obama once stated, “You should never view your challenges as a disadvantage. Instead, it’s important for you to understand that your experience facing and overcoming adversity is actually one of your biggest advantages.” That quote became extremely true for me when I decided to use the adversities that I had to overcome—both in the past and that I am overcoming right now—as motivation, constantly reminding myself that what I am aiming to achieve is much bigger than the obstacles that are getting in the way. One thing that I like about God is that He knows exactly what He is doing, and He knows how to keep me inspired through good and bad. My first year in high school, I lost my grandfather, a man who had always been so joyful, inspiring, and encouraging throughout my life. His death took a huge toll on me my freshman year because I could not understand how a man could break his leg, go to the hospital for surgery, then never return home, and just die two months later. However, after reflecting on his death and thinking about what he wanted for me in life, I used his death as inspiration throughout the remainder of my high school career, and it resulted in my graduating high school as class salutatorian with a 4.47 grade point average and a full ride to Southern University and A&amp;M College.</p>

      <p>The inspiration did not stop there. Instead, it got better. About a month after I graduated from high school, I received a call from my Louisiana Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (LA GEAR UP) regional coordinator, Ms. Timenee Thomas, stating that she received an invite from the Reach Higher initiative informing her about the Beating the Odds Summit hosted by First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House. She said she was able to bring two students, and she just so happened to choose me and my best friend, who was also apart of the LA GEAR UP program.</p>
      <p>Attending Beating the Odds was an unbelievable experience. To this day, I still have reality checks on whether or not I really attended the summit on July 23, 2015. The first day started off with a networking reception at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building the evening before, that gave students the opportunity to connect with other students and professionals that were either getting ready to go through the college experience or have already been through the experience. What made this portion so fantastic was that the students in attendance were from different backgrounds and cultures, and they had a variety of goals that they wanted to pursue, which allowed for culture exchange and information on other areas of study. It allowed me to meet some genuine, inspirational, and ambitious people, and there are some who I still communicate with today. </p>
      <p>Then came the big day. I’ll never forget this day because I remember getting dressed and going down to the White House, getting ready to go passed Secret Service. When they asked for my ID, I realized that I left it in my suit from the night before, which was back at the hotel. I was so afraid that I would lose the opportunity to attend the summit and meet the First Lady of the United States. Thankfully, one of the Secret Service men told me that if I would hurry, I would still be able to get in. Therefore, I power walked approximately 6 blocks as fast as I could to my hotel and back to grab my ID, praying that I would make it back in time. Thankfully, God brought me there and back just in time, as the men were getting ready to close the security entrance. </p>

      <p>I walked inside the White House just in time for the summit to begin. First Lady Michelle Obama came out, along with Terrence J, Wale, Arne Duncan, and Manuel Contreras. They all gave some wonderful advice to get us prepped for college that included developing relationships with professors and peers in the beginning to build a network, knowing what to do with financial aid money, being your own boss while in college, and being ambitious about what we are working for. This particular group of people that spoke to us was not just random people that come to our schools working for a private organization; no, these people were celebrities that we looked up to and aspired to be like. Hearing from them was more impactful because, although they are celebrities and quite wealthy, they still recognized the value of having an education. </p>
      <p>Although I felt inspired all around and all day long, I did not think things could get better than just having the opportunity to be in the same room as First Lady Michelle Obama. Yet, I have never been so wrong in my life because towards the end of this particular segment, Terrence J called out my name to ask her a question. I asked, “Being the first in your family to actually go to college, what obstacles did you have to overcome in order for you to pursue your education and your career in the law field?” She answered my question very thoroughly. I remember her stating that she first had to overcome the people who doubted her, along with the people that thought they were better than her. I appreciated her response because I, to this day, have people that doubt and discredit my ability to reach my dreams. Yet, I use them and their words as motivation to continue chasing after what I believe in. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I thought the best part of the day had already come and gone after she finished responding to my question. I attended lunch and connected with more people, and I also attended some of the workshops that were offered. Afterwards, everyone went to attend a private concert by Wale, and that’s where I was wrong again about how the day could not get any better. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance that ignited the entire room. One lady fainted! He came out and gave some encouraging words as well. The one thing that I took away from his remarks and applied to my life was when he said, </p>
      <h3>“If a kid born in Hawaii named Barack Obama can end up being President of the United States and a young girl born on the South Side of Chicago can end up being the First Lady, there’s nothing you can’t do.” </h3>
      <p>When he left out of the room, there was nothing more of D.C. that I could ask for. I went back home the next day, a month before college began. On day one, I was applying everything I learned from the summit by introducing myself to professors, meeting my peers, exploring financial aid options and opportunities, and more. I finished my first semester of college with a 4.0 GPA, and I obtained an internship at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, after my freshman year. I made a great group of friends, got involved with a few organizations, and even got the chance to hang out some. College was probably a better experience due to my attending the Beating the Odds Summit. </p>
      <p>Everything was fantastic during those years up until July 3, 2018, the summer before my senior year. I was back out in Los Alamos, New Mexico, working when I got the phone call from my mom saying my dad was on life support. Eleven days before, he had been hit by a tree limb that broke his leg. He went into the hospital, and they performed surgery on him  and said everything turned out fine. He was on morphine for some time so he would not feel the pain. Therefore, I was not able to have a normal conversation with him until June 30, 2018, but my heart was warmed at the thought of him being fine. However, my dad had sickle cell anemia, and the doctors claimed they could not find blood on file when he needed it most. </p>
      <p>On July 4, 2018, my dad was pronounced dead 30 minutes before I touched down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I felt as if my world was over because my dad was my best friend, and knowing his death was somewhat similar to my grandfather’s made it worse. It was like déjà vu all over again. As the days went by, I was discouraged because I felt as if I had nobody to turn to for advice, no one to encourage me when I felt like giving up, and no one to crack jokes with the way my dad and I had always done. As the time came around to go back to school, I had to have a talk with myself to find motivation and inspiration to get up and go. People told me all the time that my dad was so proud of me and all that I had accomplished. They would say that all he wanted was for me to get a good education and, of course, out of his house. Therefore, I dedicated my senior year to him and made sure that I would graduate on time. I ended up graduating in May 2019 with a 3.7 grade point average and multiple job offers. </p>

      <p>When hearing the words, “Beating the Odds,” I always begin to reflect on the obstacles that I had to overcome to get to where I am today. Although my obstacles may have not been as immense as others, they happen to be obstacles that shaped me into the man that I am today. Kelly Clarkson said it best when she sang the words, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” because after overcoming the obstacles that I have overcome thus far, I have gained more strength to face other obstacles that may come along as life goes on. I thank God, First Lady Michelle Obama, and everybody that has been involved with the creation of the summit and what it represents for all of their hard work, because they definitely had an impact on my life. Even when my dad died, the lessons and advice from the summit still inspired me to finish what I had started and have been working on so hard to achieve. I did it!</p>
