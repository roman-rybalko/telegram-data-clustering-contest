      <h1>A weekend of many words</h1>

      <p><i>The eighth edition of the Bangalore Literature Festival will treat the audience with music, theatre, dramatised readings, concerts, dance and, of course, a lot of books<br/></i><br/>On 13 April, 1919, Gen Reginald Dyer led a group of British soldiers to Jallianwala Bagh, the walled public garden in Amritsar, and ordered his troops to fire at thousands of unarmed civilians. The massacre triggered the beginning of the end of the colonial rule in India. On its centenary year, there will be a poetry reading on Khooni Vaisakhi by Navdeep Suri and singer Harpreet Singh on Day One of the 8th edition of Bangalore Literature Festival (BLF). Festival Director Shinie Antony says that this is one of the many takeaways that the two-day festival has to offer. Visitors to BLF will be able to stock their bookshelves in a well-informed way after listening live to the authors. “They will get to hear the latest views on the current burning issues,” Antony assures. “Basically, they will have a brush with the written word in its many forms; from music and lyrics, theatrical presentations, dramatised readings, to concerts, dance and books.” <br/><br/>Apart from that, the BLF is awaited by aspiring authors to pitch their ideas at the Litmart, a popular spin-off, which the organisers claim to be ‘India’s first and only pitch platform for aspiring authors’. “It’s a unique forum where budding authors get a chance to pitch their book idea to literary agents, commissioning editors and publishers,” Antony says. From about 150 entries each year, only 25 are finalised. According to Antony, there have been many success stories from the Litmarts so far, with at least four book deals with leading publishers having emerged so far; Kanchana Banerjee’s A Forgotten Affair, Issac John’s Buffering Love, Divya Anand’s Dare to Eat, and Udayan Adhye’s book whose title is yet to be confirmed. <br/><br/>So, what’s in store this edition? The festival begins with a session with the National Award-winner actor Pankaj Kapur who will be talking about his debut book Dopehri (Afternoon). Other authors who will be discussing their books and relevant topics are actors Gulshan Grover and Lisa Ray, Rajat Gupta, former CEO of McKinsey, Devdutt Pattanaik, Vikram Sampath, William Dalrymple, Sunanda Mehta and other writers from diverse genres. Singer Lucky Ali will be participating in a session called ‘Rudiments of Music’ along with Flute Butto and Rzhude David, formerly of Thermal and a Quarter. <br/><br/>International writers who will be in attendance are: Australian author Julia Prendergast and environmentalist Tim Flannery, British sci-fi writer Ian McDonald, Kenyan writer Wanjiru Koinange, and Sri Lankan writer Yudhanjaya Wijeratne. <br/><br/>There are two other components to the BLF which include sessions with bhasha writers and an evolving segment for children that is called ‘Children/Literature/Fun (CLF)’. The bhasha writers include HS Shivaprakash, Prathibha Nandakumar, Mridula Garg, Paramita Satpathy, Unni R, Johny Miranda and others. The CLF will have writing workshops, illustrations, storytelling, creative games and music performances aimed at children. <br/><br/><br/>And for the time between sessions, which we note is spare, installations will be set up across the venue. From Itihaasa, which creatively recounts the history of Indian IT sector, a virtual reality experience of Kafka through an installation called Experience the World as Gregor Samsa, to explorations of the Mendeleev’s Periodic Table marking its 150th anniversary and the popular Bengaluru Busking Project, which involves typewriting letters. <br/><br/>These and the over 230 authors and speakers will guarantee that the weekend is filled with words in every form. <br/><br/><br/><b><i>Attend BLF, from 10am, on November 9 &amp; 10, at The Lalit Ashok Hotel.
