      <p>Yun Li had been on the run since being arrested in 2015 after being found in possession of rhino horn. He was arrested along with 34-year-old Amos Mututwa. He had been granted R2 000 bail by the Germiston Magistrate’s Court. After failing to return to court, a warrant of arrest was issued for him. </p>
      <p>The case against Yun Li was postponed to November 15 for a formal bail application when he appeared on Thursday at the Germiston Magistrate's Court. Yin Li will return to the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on December 10, while Mututwa is expected to be back in court in January next year. </p>
