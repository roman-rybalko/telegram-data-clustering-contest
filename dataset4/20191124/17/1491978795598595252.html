        <i>Readers respond to Labour’s pledge of £75bn for housing, and point out the potential pitfalls</i>
      </p>
      <p>There is much to be welcomed in the Labour party’s manifesto, particularly the idea of the Sovereign Land Trust to buy land and lease it back to communities, the commitment to zero-carbon new homes and an end to right-to-buy (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/jeremy-corbyn-urges-public-to-vote-for-his-manifesto-of-hope-labour-tax-spend-plans">Corbyn unveils Labour’s most radical manifesto for decades</a>, 22 November).</p>
      <p>But – as an architect who was active in London in the 1960s and 70s, at the height of the postwar expansion of council house building – I have some misgivings about the commitment to build at a rate of 150,000 units a year. The maximum achieved during the 1950s and 60s was an average of about 200,000, following a build-up of about three years. When there was a major push to increase throughput by industrialised building and package-dealing with little or no design input from planners and architects, standards fell, social and environmental consequences were dire and many of the products of those years have been demolished.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> should learn from this that the careful construction of humane communities, which sustain lives and are loved, requires generous lead-in time. We start from a low base with most local authorities bled dry of professional expertise. Also, overheating in the construction industry runs into storages of mortals and skilled labour, producing inflation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is no mention of existing housing and the need to revive incentives to upgrade this. At present, the 20% VAT levied on maintenance and retrofit (with a few minor exemptions such as insulants) provides an inbuilt financial incentive for site clearance and new build, which is VAT exempt. Only with the equalisation of this tax across retrofit and new build can an objective cost-benefit analysis be made of alternative approaches to the existing stock.</p>
      <p>The brownfield first requirement should be revived. In the absence of these moderations, Labour’s housing policies are in danger of continuing the present dominance of big developers, demanding huge sites with immeasurable damage to social cohesion, plus continuing pressure on the green belt.<br/><b>Kate Macintosh</b><br/><i>Winchester, </i><i>Hampshire</i></p>
      <p>• You report on Labour’s promise to tackle the housing crisis as an unchallenged good (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/labour-to-unveil-75bn-social-housing-plan-to-build-for-the-many">Labour’s £75bn pledge to tackle UK housing crisis</a>, 21 November). However, if it is not accompanied by parallel investment in infrastructure and roads, it can be a disaster for individual localities.</p>
      <p>In my area, thousands of houses have been built without any additional doctors’ surgeries or schools, and in an area with just two main roads leading through the increasingly gridlocked town of Aylesbury. A ring road is promised, but only after all the houses are in place, so before that happens we face years of traffic misery and lack of facilities. The houses are not even serving local people as they are designed and priced to attract escapees from London and are unaffordable to young people who want to stay local.</p>
      <p>Finally, those of us who chose to live in smaller villages find the town steadily moving towards us, damaging our environment and polluting our air. Unrestrained building, unless matched by appropriate infrastructure and respect for the environment, can be a blight on an area.<br/><b>Jill Wallis</b><br/><i>Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire</i></p>
      <p>• Labour’s plans to spend £75bn on new build is expensive and comes with enormous social and environmental implications. The party’s plans are ambitious but, as history teaches us, unlikely to succeed. We can increase the supply of secure, affordable housing for tenants immediately by encouraging house owners to create separate, independent areas for living at market, social rents. These rents should include the cost of household charges: energy and water charges, to drive down the cost of living for tenants. House owners can benefit from a new source of income. We simply must use our existing stock to solve the housing crisis.<br/><b>Peter Ellis</b><br/><i>Founder, homeswithinhomes.org</i></p>
      <p>• As soon as the election is over all parties must agree emergency measures for homeless families and individuals. Thousands of families have been in temporary accommodation for up to and over 10 years. There are 84,740 such families in England, up 77% since 2010, <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02110">according to the House of Commons Library</a>. They cannot wait another 10 years while enough truly affordable housing is built. There are no plans in national or local government to urgently meet their needs for a permanent home.</p>
      <p>We have a social housing, affordable rents and elimination of homelessness bill ready to be launched on 16 December. It enables urgent and immediate action by national and local government. There have already been too many Christmases when rents are so high and incomes so low that debt, hunger, homelessness, mental and physical ill health are inevitable. Homeless people dying on the streets is preventable.<br/><b>Rev Paul Nicolson</b><br/><i>Taxpayers Against Poverty</i></p>
      <p>• Your article on the proposed development in north London (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/23/the-billionaire-and-the-219-tiny-flats-a-new-low-for-rabbit-hutch-britain">The billionaire and the 219 flats: a new low for rabbit hutch Britain?</a>, Money, 23 November) demonstrates the weakness of our planning laws and the “preventative approach” – the effect of deregulation.</p>
      <p>However, should the development proceed, the council has another route to address the problem. Many of these proposed flats will have a serious hazard of “crowding and space” under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) and the local housing authority has the power to prohibit their use as a dwelling under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing">Housing</a> Act 2004. This act links housing and health and defines health as including mental health, and such flats will certainly be a risk to occupiers’ mental health. The act does not distinguish between tenures, so anyone thinking of buying such a flat should beware.</p>
      <p>The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 as amended by the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018 also means that properties have to be fit when let and throughout the tenancy. The standard of fitness there also includes the HHSRS hazards and so would be actionable by any future tenants who move into these unfit flats.<br/><b>Dr Stephen Battersby</b><br/><i>Independent environmental health </i><i>and housing consultant; vice</i><i>-president, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health</i></p>
