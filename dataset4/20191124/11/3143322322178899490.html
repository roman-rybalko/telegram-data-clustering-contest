      <p>MBOMBELA – Curro Nelspruit’s annual valedictory service was recently held, during which the Grade 12s were awarded for their hard work and commitment towards academics on their last day of school.</p>
      <p>The event started with a beautiful message from Pastor Shaun Adams, from Church Unlimited. He has built a relationship with this specific grade, delivering devotions and motivational messages when he visited the school.</p>
      <p>Beautiful décor by the art department and musical items by our learners added to an emotional and befitting send-off for this dynamic group of Grade 12s.</p>
      <p>The head leaders of the school delivered a heartwarming address, in which they acknowledged the hard work and efforts made by the staff and parents towards making their tenure at school successful.</p>
      <p>Bianke Lottering and Bavukile Vilane each used the opportunity to highlight some of their most special moments with the Class of 2019.</p>
