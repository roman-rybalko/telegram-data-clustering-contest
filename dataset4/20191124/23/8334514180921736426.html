      <p>(Reuters) - Kim Sei-young sank a 25-foot birdie putt at the final hole to win the CME Group Tour Championship and the biggest prize in women’s golf, $1.5 million, in Florida on Sunday.</p>
      <p>After leading almost the entire tournament, Kim nearly blew it before coming through in unlikely circumstances at the par-four 18th, where her downhill putt broke deliciously to the right and trickled in.</p>
      <p>The South Korean carded two-under-par 70 to win by one stroke from England’s Charley Hull, who almost stole the tournament with five birdies in the final seven holes for a 66 at Tiburon Golf Club in Naples.</p>
      <p>Kim admitted that nerves had affected her putting down the home stretch as she made several poor strokes while trying to avoid thinking about the record first prize.</p>
      <p>She did not look at any leaderboards and said she was unaware the birdie putt at the last was for the win and the Race to the CME Globe title.</p>
      <p>“I was thinking, try to make two-putt, that’s my mindset,” an emotional Kim said after finishing at 18-under 270 for her 10th LPGA Tour victory at the age of 26.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to focus on my game. I don’t want to think about other players. If I see the leaderboard, sometimes it helps but sometimes it doesn’t help my emotions.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know that I was tied for the lead with Charley. After I made the putt and saw the leaderboard I was so surprised that Charley was 17 under.”</p>
      <p>Kim is the fourth Korean player to reach double-digit LPGA victories, joining Pak Se-ri (25), Park In-bee (19) and Shin Ji-yai (11).</p>
      <p>All of her 10 victories have come since 2015, and nobody on tour has won more often during this period.</p>
      <p>But though she is no stranger to success, it still was not easy playing with the lead all four days in the final LPGA event of the year.</p>
      <p>“I tried to make myself relax but going to the final round still got nervous,” Kim said.</p>
      <p>“I tried to calm myself but it didn’t work. It was really nervous the whole 18.”</p>
      <h3>GATECRASHER HULL</h3>
      <p>Hull, barely an afterthought until her late charge, nearly gatecrashed the party with birdies at the final three holes, including a 10-footer at the last after a superb eight-iron approach shot.</p>
      <p>The 2016 winner barely qualified to play this year and was 51st in the standings at the start of the week. Her play down the stretch belied her low ranking.</p>
      <p>Americans Danielle Kang (65) and Nelly Korda (71) were also in contention, eventually finishing two shots behind Kim.</p>
      <p>Kim’s win capped off another dominant year for South Korean players, who have ruled women’s golf for the best part of two decades.</p>

      <p>They combined to win 15 of 32 LPGA tournaments in 2019, with Ko Jin-young leading the way with four victories.</p>
      <p>Ko won the money list and also collected the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average of 69.06. Only Annika Sorenstam has ever scored better.</p>
