        <b>WHAT is Ludwig’s angina?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ludwig’s angina is a bacterial infection. It is a type of bacterial infection that occurs in the floor of the mouth, under the tongue. It often develops after an infection of the roots of the teeth (such as tooth abscess) or a mouth injury. This condition is uncommon in children but in adult.</p>
      <p>The bacteria Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are common causes. It often follows a mouth injury or infection, such as a tooth abscess. Other causes include poor dental hygiene; trauma or lacerations in the mouth and a recent tooth extraction or tooth ache.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How can it be prevented?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You can decrease your risk of developing Ludwig’s angina by practicing good oral hygiene, having regular dental checkups, seeking prompt treatment for tooth and mouth infections. If you’re planning on getting a tongue piercing, make sure it’s with a professional using clean, sterile tools. See your doctor immediately if you have excess bleeding or the swelling isn’t going down.</p>
      <p>You should brush your teeth twice every day and use mouthwash with antiseptic liquid once per day. Never ignore any pain in your gums or teeth. You should see your dentist if you notice a foul smell coming from your mouth or if you’re bleeding from your tongue, gums, or teeth. Pay close attention to any problems in your mouth area. See your doctor immediately if you have a compromised immune system or have recently had some sort of trauma in your mouth, including a tongue piercing. If you have a mouth injury, make sure to see your doctor so that they can ensure it is healing properly. Also use of preventive oral aid (local chewing stick) such as Aayan, Orin Ata by young people should be encouraged; this will help in keeping their teeth till old age.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What next after losing your teeth?</b>
      </p>
      <p>For those who have lost one tooth or more, hope is not lost. They can still do a lot to salvage their remaining teeth. You can have an implant; don’t brush the socket. Either way, the area may be tender at first, and brushing even with soft-bristled toothbrush can irritate it. Instead, brush the other teeth properly, but avoid those around the socket  and the socket itself  for about a day to give it time to heal.</p>
      <p>Focus on good oral care for the whole mouth: daily oral care is the best way to protect your teeth (and sockets) and stave off any risk of plaque buildup or early gingivitis. Brush your teeth twice daily. Finally, avoid an excess of sugary snacks.</p>
