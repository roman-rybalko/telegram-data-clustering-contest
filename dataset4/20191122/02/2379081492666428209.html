      <h1>China revises up nominal 2018 GDP, says won't impact 2019 growth calculation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:27:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:27</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>BEIJING — China on Friday revised up its nominal 2018 gross domestic product (GDP) by 2.1% to 91.93 trillion yuan ($13.08 trillion), keeping it on track to achieving its goal of doubling the size of its economy by 2020 from 2010.</p>
      <p>The revisions showed that the services sector contributed more to GDP in 2018 than the original data had indicated, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The change in the size of 2018 GDP will not significantly influence the calculation for the 2019 growth rate, the statistics bureau said.</p>
      <p>The world’s second-biggest economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost three decades, pressured in part by a trade war with the United States.</p>
      <p>China routinely revises its annual GDP data. Days before GDP data for 2018 was released in January, the statistics bureau cut its final 2017 growth figure to 6.8% from 6.9%.</p>
      <p>China’s fourth National Economic Census, released on Wednesday, included “richer” data points that showed more business entities and a bigger total asset base in 2018 than assumed under earlier GDP estimates, Li Xiaochao, deputy head of the statistics bureau, told Reuters earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Revisions to historical GDP figures will also be made, Li told reporters.</p>
      <p>The government’s target range for 2019 growth is 6%-6.5%. The economy expanded 6.4% in the first quarter, 6.2% in the second and 6.0% in the third – the weakest pace since 1992.</p>
      <p>Growth of about 6.2% is seen needed for the whole of this year and the next to meet the Communist Party’s longstanding goal of doubling GDP and incomes in the decade to 2020.</p>
