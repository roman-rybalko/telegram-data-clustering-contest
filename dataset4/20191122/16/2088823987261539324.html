      <p>Harrison Phillips instantly recognized that pop in his left knee. It took him right back to that first game of his sophomore year at Stanford.</p>
      <p>Back to the sickening feeling his season was over before it actually had a chance to begin. Back to the fear and the doubt and the loneliness. Back to the pain and the sweat and the tears.</p>
      <p>So many tears.</p>
      <p>"I was bawling and crying," Phillips said of the night of Sept. 22, hours after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament late in the Buffalo Bills' 21-17 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals. "I mean, I was extremely upset."</p>
      <p>Same injury. Same knee. And even before the Bills' medical staff received the results from the MRI exam, the second-year reserve defensive tackle knew it would be the same result as he had in 2015: no football until the following fall.</p>
      <p>"Then, the next morning, we got the MRI results back, and they told me," he said. "Again, I was extremely emotional, devastated. I couldn't even call my family (in Omaha, Neb.). For a good half-hour, 45 minutes, it was just uncontrollable sobbing. And then the doctors and staff came back in and we had to figure out a plan. Then, it all became goal-oriented and I could see a tunnel."</p>
      <p>The following week, Phillips was in Florida undergoing surgery in which the patellar tendon from his right knee was grafted to replace the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.</p>
      <p>"When I woke up from surgery, the doctor had me do a leg lift on the operating table," he said. "The next day, I had two-a-days of physical therapy, just trying to flex my quad, just sitting there for 45 minutes and try to flex your quad or try to pump your ankles. I had both legs operated on, so I was in a wheelchair and couldn't really walk. But by the time I left, eight days later, I was using my right leg to walk with crutches. It wasn't pretty, but I could do it.</p>
      <p>"Ever since, I've just been focused on the return."</p>
      <p>Phillips can only hope that, at least, part of his knee injury history repeats itself.</p>
      <p>After the torn ACL he suffered at Stanford, he played in 26 games through the final two seasons of his collegiate career. He also performed well enough to help convince the Bills to make him a third-round draft pick in 2018.</p>
      <p>In the latest edition of One-on-One Coverage, The Buffalo News sat down with Phillips to talk about the injury, the challenges of rehabilitation, life on IR, and giving back to the community.</p>

        <i>
          <b>Buffalo News: Let's start in the obvious place. How's the knee?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Harrison Phillips:</b> Yeah, doing OK. I would say, even with as good as things are going physically in the rehab, mentally it's just so tough to ever really have like great days. There's small victories here and there. It's fun to be doing more stuff, too, week by week as you progress. But now I'm in the thick of it. Just hit Week Seven and, really, six through 10 to 12, you can't really do much more because your body is rejecting your (new) ACL. That's the window where your ACL is its weakest. Then, as your body gets used to it, it starts strengthening. And so I'll just be doing the same stuff I have been doing for last couple weeks for the next month or so. It gets real repetitive after this, then it gets fun. You start running again, you start jumping, you start doing football drills and really becoming a better athlete. But I'm happy with where I'm at and I'm optimistic about my return.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, people come back at six months. Six months from the injury, I'm not playing a game. But that doesn't mean that we're going to slow anything down rehab-wise. That means that it's more of a nine-month injury, because I won't play football again for nine months. So, yes, OTAs, we can do some stuff. I'll jog around and with some helmets on and do football drills, but I'm not going to be fully padded and play a double team with 700 pounds coming at me until training camp.</p>

        <i>
          <b>BN: Walk me through what happened on the play you were injured against the Bengals?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP:</b> It was a run play down in the red zone. It was second down and we had a stunt on, so I crossed the guard's face and I was free, ready to go make a tackle. As I kind of went to shoot, I took on another blocker, so I was standing up and my leg was extended. Another player, who was tied up in a block, was thrown into me. He hit me right below my knee and my tibia jolted back and there was a pop. I went down, obviously, because he hit me in the leg. I was in on the tackle, and then I quickly got up and ran off the field as fast as I could and was calling for a sub to run in for me for the third down. We got a third-down stop, and they kicked a field goal (to take a 17-14 lead).</p>
      <p>As I got to sideline, I said (to the medical staff), "You guys need to look at my knee." I went to the injury tent and they were testing it. They said, "Well, you're a little lax." That just means there's a little wiggle in your knee. Then they said, "If you've torn this one before, you might have a little lax." I was all fired up from the game so my quads were really tight so they couldn't really tell (the extent of the injury). When it popped and the way that it popped, I was like, "This isn't OK." But it wasn't 100% clear, so the competitor in me was obviously going to go back on that field. I mean, imagine if I sat out and we got an MRI and they're like, "Oh, no, there's nothing wrong." I did some tests on the sideline and, again, my body was compensating, so that I passed those tests.</p>
      <p>So they said, "We'll just brace you and see if you can go out there." We put the brace on and taped it and I went out there with a big prayer with 1:50 left to go win the game, with us up by 4 points. The first play, I had a pass-rush move dialed up. I planted on my leg and as I stepped on it, I just fell to the ground. No pain, really. There was just nothing there, so I just rolled to the ground. The rest of the guys on the defense were saying, "Get up! Get up!" I knew I had torn it, so I just stayed down. The trainers came out and the coach came out and they were asking, "What's wrong?" But I was just too emotional to even talk because I knew what it was.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>BN: It already was an emotional day, with the Bills choosing that day to honor the memory of Pancho Billa, the late superfan you had befriended last year. You even wore a sombrero during pregame introductions.</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP:</b> There's even more beneath the surface. The week before, against the Giants, I played my best game in the NFL. I got the game ball. I had a good game against the Jets and, for the Giants game, they kind of moved me up the depth chart on the third-down stuff because I have the ability to call a lot of the games very easily. That was the biggest goal that I worked for since I declared for the NFL draft. I thought I'd be put in the category as a run-stopper. I got here and wasn't on the third-down rush group last year. And through the whole offseason, all through training camp, all I worked for was to go rush the passer. Tackle quarterbacks is what I want to do and, finally, the Bengals week, I earned that spot. The first third down of the game, I run out there with the "green" group. I played well, had a couple hurries, almost had a sack. So from my highest of highs as a player to then my lowest lows.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>BN: What were you doing in that Giants game that stood out to the coaches?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP:</b> I think I just got more opportunities. I got to play more and I got to play more in bigger situations, I guess. Like playing on third down or playing when they were in the red zone or playing when they were backed up. Typically, NFL backups are in between the 30s. We'll go in there so our starters can go get rested and then come back out to make the bigger plays. I was productive. I was really feeling good and really getting confident in my ability to play.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>BN: How lonely is life on IR?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP:</b> I mean, it's kind of whatever you make it, but at the end of the day, the whole team and all the training staff go out to practice at 12 o'clock and no one comes back until 2. I go to as many meetings as I can, but I have to miss one or two for my rehab every day. And then there's that two-hour (practice) window that is really like three hours because we don't have meetings 'till 3, so it's three hours of the day that are kind of unaccounted for. So I have to find ways to keep busy, whether it's do more and more rehab – more exercises, more lifts, cardio, watch film, recovery. We have that amazing facility. But, yeah, it gets a little lonely. Away games get lonely, too.</p>

          <b>BN: How tough was it during the Dolphins game last Sunday to see each of the four active defensive tackles on the roster get a sack?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP:</b> Throughout the whole season, it seems that emotions really only come into play on really good plays or really bad plays. And so that first week I was out, watching the Patriots game, it was terrible because if a run got up the middle, you just think like, "Dang! I wonder, if I was healthy, if I would have been able to help that." Or, "If I would have been able to hold a double team, someone else would have been able to do something." Then, the very good plays that our guys make – we have some really, really good defensive tackles in our room – so as they're making plays and sacks and tackles for loss and splitting double teams, I also think, "Oh, dang! Maybe that would have been me if I was healthy."</p>
      <p>But what's really good about our room is that we're such a family. Internally, it's sad and kind of depressing on me, but I'm so excited and so happy for the guys that are playing so well. For Star (Lotulelei) to get a sack last week, Jordan (Phillips) to be playing for a huge contract, Ed (Oliver) to start making a name for himself in the league and Corey (Liuget), who just came here … I love all those guys, so it's great to see them succeed.</p>
      <p>They try to help me, they try to make me feel like I'm involved still. I lead a couple meetings on our off day. I hold a meeting on Tuesdays just to break down the film of the week and see what I've seen from our future opponents and give them my opinions, as well, as we watch tape in the meeting room. I'll lean over to someone and say, "Oh, hey, I'd play this this way." Or, "When the Y motions over here, I'd switch to a G because they run heavy to a Yak motion." Or, "When so-and-so's in a 20 Look, watch the lead." All these different things that I see. And they listen to what I say. Also, we always go to someone's house for the Thursday night game, so I'm always included in those things, too.</p>
      <p>I love this game more than anything. I'd say I love it as much as anybody in the NFL has ever loved the game. And it sucks because I try to do everything right and go the extra mile. Any workout I've ever done, if it says do 10 reps, I did 11 or I did 12. And when everyone was out at practice, I tried to be the last one to leave and the first one out there. People will go home on the weekends. I tried to come in and do extra work and stuff. I felt like I was just trying to do everything right, so it sucks when bad things happen to people who do it the right way, I guess.</p>
      <p>But if this all goes as planned, like it did at Stanford, I got hurt my second year and my third year, I was an all-conference player. And my fourth year, I was one of the best players in the nation at my position. I broke some records for my school and so if I have that same path here, come year four, hopefully, I play great enough that the Bills would extend me and I could play here for a very long time.</p>

          <b>BN: How much has your relationship with Ezra Castro, Pancho Billa, and his family stuck with you?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP:</b> Just small reminders here and there. I still text (Castro's longtime partner) Veronica (Borjon) quite often and check in on the kids. And she reaches out to me to see how rehab's going and stuff like that. Every once in a while, I'll look down at my (left) wrist with the "Pancho Power" (band) on. Or I'll see a fan who's got a Pancho's Army shirt on or something and you just get that kind of warm feeling thinking about it. I think I'm wearing a Pancho T-shirt now (he pulls up his hoodie to reveal it).</p>

          <b>BN: You held your third Playmakers event in Buffalo Tuesday night at Dave &amp; Buster's. How did this start?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP:</b> Playmakers is a nonprofit and I'm on the board and help run it. It started in Sacramento, Calif., as an after-school program 12 months a year targeted toward at-risk youth to increase literacy skills. I've been involved with it for seven years, starting in my freshman year at Stanford. I tried to bring that style of year-round after-school programs to Omaha, but it was just really difficult because I couldn't get someone to kind of run the show. The better model is these kind of one-off camps and one-off activities that we do with the same kids in Buffalo. They're called Harrison's Playmakers and my Playmaker Pups, and we've moved from kind of more at-risk to more kids with developmental differences and special needs. We just feel like there's not a lot of organizations that do what we do.</p>
      <p>Our first event was here in Buffalo in our indoor facility. We had a football camp, had about 125 kids come. We have a quarterback station, a running back station, a tug of war station, a photo booth station, a receivers station. We really implement fun and building those character values that come through sports, such as falling and getting back up and celebrating the little things, teamwork, all those great character values that are learned through sports and football, specifically.</p>
      <p>We're also going to sponsor a Christmas wish list for kids at HighPointe, under the Kaleida Health umbrella. These are kids with severe genetic disabilities, no family, for the most part, involved. We got a wish list from some of the nurses and people I've talked to over there. No Xboxes or things like that. It's mainly anything that plays music or they can tap different buttons to make noise and light up and stuff. It really does make them smile. Then, we're going to go to Ilio DiPaolo's Restaurant on Dec. 16 and we'll have a party, maybe with an ugly sweater theme, and we're going to wrap all the presents and make cards for the kids. Dennis DiPaolo is donating all the food.</p>
      <p>There's definitely perspective where, "Yeah, rehab was hard today and my knee hurt, but I'm going to be a full functioning adult, independent, on my own. Some of these kids will never be able to be fully independent. I can drive to work. I mean, these kids are 18 and will never get a license." But there's also the other side where it's like, "Dang! I really want to make these kids happy, because they went out and got my jersey. I want to make sure I'm out there playing for these guys."</p>
