        <i>When almost everyone wants to buy certain stocks in the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/markets">markets</a>, it is obvious that the rest of the spaces tend to become more value and if you are seeking value, then you become a contra investor. says <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Prashant-Jain">Prashant Jain</a></b>, ED &amp; CIO, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/hdfc-asset-management-company-ltd/stocks/companyid-14723.cms">HDFC AMC</a></b>. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>It is often said in the market that investing is very easy, it is common sense and a little bit of patience. So if investing is so simple. how come you do not have too many billionaires on the street? How come there is only one Prashant Jain?<br/></b>I think I am not the only one, there are quite a few who have done very well in the markets, may not be in a mutual fund format for 25 years but there are quite a few of them. But yes, equities are a very simple asset class but as it is said, what is simple is not always easy.</p>
      <p>I think to do well in equities we need right understanding which can be very easy for some and can be very challenging for others. Apart from right understanding we need lots of patience, tolerance for volatility and the discipline to a) remain diversified and b), not to deviate or compromise from what you believe is good for the long term.</p>
      <p><b>You started your career as a fund manager. A lot of fund managers start as analysts, migrate to the sell side, then the buy side and then become a fund manager. When did the realisation kick in for you that you wanted to be a fund manager because that meant you need to understand cycles, valuations, macro environment, interest rate environment?<br/></b>You may find it hard to believe but the fact is I had actually qualified for the civil services. I went home to discuss with my parents and it took us 10 days to decide that I would actually not join civil services.</p>
      <p><b>Government job versus private job?<br/></b>I had an offer from SBICAP those days. There was a Day 1 company and I was at that time in Bangalore. I joined 10 days late, behind all my other batch mates. They had 14 people that year from IIMs and I was the last one to join. When I joined, Mr Sriram was the GM and he said very apologetically son, I am extremely sorry, all the good postings are gone. All you can do now is equity research. Seriously! So those days, project appraisal, merchant banking, marketing was preferred over equity research and fund management. That is how within a short period of two years, I was made a fund manager.</p>
      <p><b>What would you choose for your son -- civil services or a fund manager’s job? Which is a more stable career for the next 20 years?<br/></b>I would say civil services and I will explain why.</p>
      <p><b>You are being politically right?<br/></b>No, no, no. I mean, data is king. It is a misnomer in the country that the private sector pays more. Nothing could be farther from the truth. You look at the average salary. This entire country believes otherwise, but what has happened is the media highlights only the most successful people in the private sector who of course can draw any amount of salaries, there is an impression that the private sector pays more. It is not true at all.</p>
      <p>The starting salary of an engineer in a public sector is about four times that of the starting salary of IIT engineers. I am saying average salary meaning the total employee cost divided by the total headcount of a public sector company is 60-70% more than that of a leading IT company.</p>
      <p>As a result of the very large addition to the white collar workforce from a large number of engineering, MBA colleges. the white collar salaries in India in private sector have actually degrown in real terms.</p>
      <p>And of course, the final thing is in equities, the survival rate is very low. I have been in this industry for 30 years and to retain good jobs in financial services, particularly beyond 40, is increasingly getting challenging because your cost keeps on going up and in financial services, the only cost is wages. So, if you are not up to it or if the downturn comes, it is the middle to senior level people, who are often the casualties.</p>
      <p>
        <b>I will take the clock back. When you started your career, obviously that was a different India. Our GDP was nowhere close to even a trillion dollars - it must have been $100 billion or $250 billion. Today, at $3 billion, we one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Did you imagine when you started your investing career that we could have a TCS which has a profit of Rs 35,000 crore or Reliance which has a projected profit of Rs 40.000 crore?</b>
      </p>
      <p>To give you a very correct answer, no I never thought that long. I have tried to do the best every single day, I have tried to think ahead in terms of investing but clearly I do not think I ever thought that we would become this large, we would have this big companies. But one thing I must say is that I had a firm belief and a desire to remain in India and to work in India. I understood this much that given the demographics the natural resources and the capabilities of people in this country, it will continue to grow but clearly I did not extrapolate that this will become such a large economy.</p>
      <blockquote>Never before in India has our financial savings rate fallen. I think that is because the white collar wages have de-grown. The only way to fix this is to grow our investments.<br/>-Prashant Jain</blockquote>
      <p><b>For those who are worried about slowdown, global growth, drop in autos, do you think the strength of India will prove them wrong once again?<br/></b>For sure, the growth will bounce back in India but it could take a little time. Going back to the same issue that I raised earlier, the white collar wages in India have degrown in real terms and new avenues of consumption have arrived in India. The mobile handset market is as large as the car market and if you do not have enough money, you would clearly buy a mobile phone over a car. This is what is leading to a drop in consumer discretionary consumption in India. But cutting the corporate tax rates by the government should help.</p>
      <p>Given the backdrop of the US-China trade war and the fact that Chinese wages are now higher than Indian wages, the wages in the manufacturing sector and their manufactured exports are almost seven-eight times of India. A serious attempt is being made and should be made to encourage global companies to set up shop in India. Yesterday, I read that government has identified 323 global companies to whom they will say, we have lowered tax rates, we have a huge local market this is the piece of land, water, power, what do you want? Please come here. I think that is what will revive wage growth and economic growth in India. Given the March 23 deadline for a concessional tax rate for new manufacturing units of 15%, sooner rather than later, we should see good movement on that front.</p>
      <p><b>Post the tax cut, we have not seen a large indication or announcement from any of the large corporate houses that they are ready to commit capital. Is that the challenge right now that corporate houses are either scared or they do not have the ability or the will or the scale to commit capital? <br/></b>You need to divide potential capex by private sector in three areas; some businesses are fundamentally less capital intensive; let us say a FMCG or services businesses and no matter what taxes you cut, they will not spend more because they are in that type of business which needs capital expenditure.</p>
      <p>The second are the capital intensive businesses and these are businesses like power, infrastructure or metals. Now unfortunately, these three sectors which drove the capex cycle in India last time around, many companies have very difficult balance sheets, many of them are under the bankruptcy proceedings and the ones that are healthy would rather buy the existing assets under IBC which are cheaper.</p>
      <p>All the power plants that are being sold or will be sold, they are nearly half of the replacement cost. As long as existing assets are available to be cheaper, I do not think new capex will revive in the capital intensive sectors. The IBC process and most of the existing assets will find new buyers or new homes by March of this year.</p>
      <p>Post that, we should see private capex revive in these areas and that is why I said earlier that the real opportunity for India in the near term is to get those 300 or so global companies into India because we buy a Samsung television, we buy a mobile phone. If an Indian company puts up a TV factor or a mobile factory, we will not buy those products. Our consumption basket is tilted more towards imports. We need to bring in those companies and they can make for India and for the world in India.</p>
      <p><b>You are a firm believer of cycles. It is not that you have not bought consumer stocks in the past. In 2008-2009, one of your largest holding was Titan followed by Page. Now, you do not have consumer stocks in your portfolio. Why is that?<br/></b>I do not subscribe to this view that good businesses/good investment at any price and that is not borne out by my experience over the last three decades. Certainly we should buy a sustainable business but beyond that for a good business to become a good investment, the price must be good also. I can give you several examples. If you bought IT stocks in late 90s to early 2000s, for 10-15 years, you hardly made any money because they were so expensive and future growth was discounted by 2000.</p>
      <p>If you bought FMCG companies in 1995, for the next 10 years, there was zero returns because they were so expensive in 1995. They were growing businesses. They were great businesses in 1995 and 2005 as well. Consumer stocks in India today are trading at life time high multiples. Never before in my experience have they traded so expensive and nowhere in the world do they trade at even probably half the valuations.</p>
      <p>While these are good and sustainable businesses, the expectations from these are unlikely to be met. Let us not forget that many of these are reasonably mature businesses. India sells two crore two-wheelers a year and may be in India there are 15 to 20 crore two-wheelers on the roads. Almost two out of three families own a two-wheeler. Soaps, shampoos, toothpaste are good businesses again but to expect them to grow very fast is not correct because they are reasonably mature businesses. I want to pay good attention to what price I am buying, apart from the sustainability of a business and these businesses do not pass the valuation test.</p>
      <p><b>But if one looks at the India story, perhaps with the exception of Reliance, it is centred around consumers, autos and private banks. You do not have a very large manufacturing company, you do not have anything very large which has become export front company in terms of manufacturing. Why is that?<br/></b>That is true then because it is hard to explain and probably unfortunate in the 90s. Till the 1990s, India’s per capita income was the same or higher than China.</p>
      <p><b>Is it true?<br/></b>Yes and today Chinese per capita income is five times of us. While we made a success in the services industry, in manufacturing, China went decades ahead of us. So if you look at the composition of the Sensex today, there are very few manufacturing companies in that -- 30% is financial services, 20% like IT, pharmaceuticals and oil and gas and metals are global cyclicals. That is 50% of the market; another 20% would be consumer discretionary, non-discretionary. That is 70% and only 10% is companies like Larsen &amp; Toubro.</p>
      <p>So that shows up in our GDP composition. What is the contribution of manufacturing to GDP? But I think all is not lost. For the first time in my career, in the last one-two years Indian companies in chemicals, textiles, auto ancillaries tell us that the wages or the cost of manufacturing in India is lower than China. That was not the case 15 years back. The compliance with environment standards is improving in China. The subsidies are reducing. So India is now comparative in rupees terms and that is why this tax cut has come at a very opportune time.</p>
      <p>Our manufactured exports at $300 billion are roughly the same size as of Vietnam, Thailand or Indonesia and they are countries which are one-tenth the size of India. In case of China, it is $2.5 trillion. Given the right tax rates, given the right environment and the advantage of a massive local market which none of these neighbouring countries have, it is reasonable to expect that many of these global multi-nationals who are present in China, when they move out of China or reduce their footprint there, will get a higher share in future than what we have got so far.</p>
      <p><b>You have mentioned the weightage of Nifty. The weightage of the Nifty in 2000 was very different. It was dominated by TMT. Ten years from now, what to your mind could be the face of the Nifty because we understand that is where wealth is going to get created?<br/></b>It was very different in the 90s. By 2000, it was very different and today it is very different. It probably reflects the economic growth and which sectors get undervalued or overvalued like tech. I vaguely remember in late 90s or early 2000, tech was almost half of the market weights. But it was reflecting as much the growth of the sector as the overvaluation because these are market cap driven indices. I think</p>
      <p>I think investment growth, investments should outgrow consumption in India. Unless you do that, it will be very tough for this economy to grow. Household debt in India has gone up very sharply. It used to be 2% in 2000. Today it is 20%. Our savings rate has dipped in last 10 years. In 2010 or 2008, our financial savings rate used to be 12%, today it is down to 8%. Never before in India has our financial savings rate fallen. I think that is because the white collar wages have de-grown. I think the only way to fix this is to grow your investments.</p>
      <p>If investments grow, you create more jobs. It gives you more salaries and then you can come back and spend. And again, most countries have experienced rapid economic growth in the past. It has been driven by exports -- whether it was Japan, Korea or Germany. It is China now. When these global companies come to India, hopefully it will increase our merchandise manufactured exports as well. Future businesses that will grow faster will be around capital spending, manufacturing and of course financial services will keep pace with the GDP growth.</p>
      <p><b>The recent downturn, HUL has managed to grow, Bajaj Finance has managed to grow and big companies are the only ones which are growing. Are we in an environment where the existing 50, 70, 100 companies will become giant companies, giant will become mega and mega will become monster?<br/></b>I do not think there can be any generalisation to that trend. For example, many NBFCs pioneered a new area for credit but over time, as it became large, banks centred and then they gained share back from the NBFCs.</p>
      <p>For the first time in this season, I some leading banks offered you loans for very small consumer items and today in India you can get an EMI on a debt card as well. So over time, banks will be able to address the small consumer loans from the market because it will all be digitally delivered and they know their customers extremely well. It will be driven by analytics. While those companies which continue to be ahead of the competition will do well, there is always place for companies which execute better. But banks will be formidable competition in the days to come, even small retail loans.</p>
      <p>As far as Lever is concerned, it is a great company. It has outstanding brands, extremely well managed, global based practices, it continues to grow, it continues to premiumise but Lever continues to grow at broadly the same rates at what it has grown for a long period. I think Levers’ business is reasonably easy to forecast. Where people have different views is what they are willing to pay for that quality and for that growth.</p>
      <p><b>You have taken contra bets not yesterday, not last year, but in your entire investing career. You have bought for example, corporate banks when everybody was focussing on retail banks. You bought into PSUs when PSUs were not the popular trades in the market; you bought consumer names when there was a bias towards infrastructure. How do you come up with a thesis and idea and conclude that it is time to go contra? <br/></b>I am extremely non-violent by nature. I do not believe in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/contra-investing">contra investing</a> but I do believe in value investing. And if <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/value-investing">value investing</a> at a point of time means that you think differently from others then so be it. As I said earlier, I have always tried to buy reasonably quality businesses, not always high quality because sometimes they are very expensive and I have always focussed on what you pay for them.</p>
      <p>It is quite logical that when a good business is passing through a challenging time or when some other businesses are doing extremely well on the stock markets and since most people in life and in stock markets as well, are very short term focussed, they want to avoid short term pain and get short term gains. When almost everyone wants to buy certain stocks in the markets, it is obvious that the rest of the spaces tend to become more value and if you are seeking value, then you become a contra investor. So contra is an outcome of seeking value but seeking value is the key.</p>
      <p>I will give you two, three examples here; around 1999-2000, the IT stocks were trading at 300-400 multiples and even I agreed that they will continue to grow for many years, which indeed they did. But it is just that that more of that growth was discounted than the real growth. And so they were great businesses, growing businesses but bad investments and since everyone was buying IT and nothing but IT, almost everything else became so cheap that it is hard to explain. You could have bought BPCL in 2000 for just the value of the LPG cylinders. You could have bought <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ashok-leyland-ltd/stocks/companyid-14041.cms">Ashok Leyland</a> for less than the working capital on the balance sheet. That was one great example and these businesses which grew slower but delivered far higher returns because if you buy something at 2 or 2 PE and if it goes to 15 PE it is a five or six bagger.</p>
      <p>Around 2008, just the opposite happened; this was one time when quality was at a discount. So, around 2008, you could buy the consumer companies, pharma companies, automobile companies in single digit or low double digit multiples. We used to own Glaxo Consumer. They make Horlicks at 12 PE, I bought it at 18 and I saw it fall to 12 PE.</p>
      <p>People used to tell me look Horlicks is had by only sick or old people, there is no future to this business because at that time, everyone wanted to buy only infrastructure, power and real estate companies as they were doing well. So I think I have seen this time and again that the definition of quality changes and what is going up tends to get overvalued.</p>
      <p>But I must say that sometimes in the last few years, like you have mentioned we have been overweight on corporate banks. It can test your patience because when a business is in pain, it is cheap and you are buying it in the hope that that pain will go away one day and that the business is strong enough to survive that period of pain.</p>
      <p>The Essar Steel case it took almost three years to resolve and we were hoping given the IBC deadlines that that resolution will take place much earlier. And that is why value investing becomes difficult at times because something in the environment changes and the pain period gets extended but the key is to buy a strong business so that it is able to endure that period of pain and you should of course, be able to endure that pain because in the end if your assessment of value is right, no matter how long it takes, the value does unfold and the investment gives you the returns for the entire holding period.</p>
      <p><b>Great example on Ashok Leyland, great example on Glaxo but what do you find cheap now?<br/></b>I will give you an answer. Track our portfolio. A person likes it most is the overweights and underweights. Let me answer that more specifically. This is my opinion and many people disagree with me. The public sector companies to my mind are misunderstood by the markets.</p>
      <p>There are sectors in which public sector is at a disadvantage like the service industry and there are sectors where public sector has a significant advantage which are resource rich areas like mining, where you have mines which have been given to you 20-30-50-100 years back and where you have huge economies of scale or companies or sectors which are very capital intensive. Let us say oil or power or where faith is involved, let us say public banks.</p>
      <p>So when a PMC happens, you will never find a situation like this in a public bank. The ability to collect large amounts of money at low interest rates is a very strong comparative advantage for some of these banks. I find because of the frequent divestment by the governments and particularly through ETFs in the last few years, this persistent supply has made these companies very cheap.</p>
      <p>Many of these companies, especially in the mining, oil and gas, some of the strong banks, power sector are very sustainable businesses and they are also very cheap. You can figure that out by just looking at price to book or the dividend yields on these companies. Most people do not like it because if you have bought these companies in the last two, three, five years, you have not done well at all. They have caused immense pain but I think they are sustainable businesses.</p>
      <p>They are trading below their intrinsic values and what gives me hope is the shift in government strategy towards strategic divestment. So if in future if that becomes the main route for divesting these companies, it will tell us the real value of these companies -- what a strategic investor is willing to pay. Hopefully. it will also reduce the frequent supply of these stocks in the market.</p>
      <p><b>One question on the way the markets have moved. Is buy and hold dead or would buy and hold be never dead?<br/></b>Clearly investing delivers far more returns than trading and I do not think there is any denying that fact. Someone has to be exceptionally talented as a trader to make money and unless you have it in you, investing is a far more secure and predictable way of making money, long-term investing, that means buy and hold.</p>
      <p>It also means that there are two underlying assumptions. There are two things you need to be careful about. One is you must buy sustainable businesses. You must not over pay, if you bought tech in 1999 and you held it for 10 years, it was not a good decision. The day you realised that mistake in 2001, you should have corrected.</p>
      <p>If you held pharma four years back when it was very expensive and you can see what pain is there. First, you must buy right and buy right means a reasonable quality business and not an expensive one. You can hold it as long as you think it offers you reasonable value, as long as your exposure to that stock does not go up beyond what your risk management would indicate or as long as you do not have something materially better.</p>
      <p>Our portfolio turnover rates are clearly much below averages but they vary sometimes between two to five years.</p>
      <p><b>Let us divide broadly India into three parts. First, where you have evergreen good growth, financial sectors, private banks, insurance where growth is very strong. Second part, where because of distress valuations, stocks have gone up and down like PSU banks, corporate banks; a third business where you can catch them early which can become big over time, We know that you like PSU banks in bracket two. What do you like in bracket one which is compounders and in bracket three where businesses are young and can become big?<br/></b>A better way to describe my view on banks would be that I like corporate banks -- both public and private. They are equally large with us and simply because they were in pain, their liability franchise was very strong and the asset side was in pain and you thought that it will become correct and some of these banks have actually done quite well now.</p>
      <p>Identifying the third is always a challenge. IT was a fairly obvious choice in late 90s and infra growth was there but it was on sustainable and today I am not able to find any piece in the economy which will grow extremely rapidly. But I do feel that capex and manufacturing will grow faster than consumption.</p>
      <p>But there are sectors like airlines, there are sectors like organised retail which could grow fast. But fast growth alone is not enough for the markets. The moment you say this business is growing at 30% for the next 10 years, you must ask are you the only one who knows that or does the whole market know that? Chances are everyone in the market knows that and even quality companies are growing in a sustained way. So the next question you have to ask is whether your growth estimate is higher than others or if you think growth will sustain longer than what other think or what markets are discounting.</p>
      <p>Growth investing is very tempting but most often it pays less than value investing and because people simply extrapolate the high growth rates of the last few years for very,very long periods into the future. I will give you a good example. In 2000, there were many reports by consulting firms which were saying that this IT industry will become large -- $100 billion or more in the next five or eight years. It is only recently that that industry crossed $100 billion. So, we were 10 years late. Now the challenge with that was that if that growth rate slowed down, you simply lost a lot of money. That is why it is not as simple as just buying a business which will continue to grow.</p>
      <p>Markets made the same mistake in pharmaceuticals. If you look at last three-four years, the stocks are down 70%, 60%. That is because the growth rate prior to 2014 or 2015 in pharma was extrapolated indefinitely virtually and that is how they were good companies but turned out to be not so good investments.</p>
