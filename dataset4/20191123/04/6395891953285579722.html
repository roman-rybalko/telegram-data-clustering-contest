      <p><b>ST. THOMAS, U.S VIRGIN ISLANDS (AP)</b> - Justin Turner scored 27 points and hit the game-winner with a pretty jump shot in the final four seconds as Bowling Green edged Western Kentucky 77-75 in the U.S. Virgin Islands Paradise Jam on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Dylan Frye had 19 points for Bowling Green (4-1).</p>
      <p>The Falcons had fallen behind 74-67 with five minutes remaining, but rallied as Western Kentucky saw a sequence of missed 3, turnover, missed 3, miss and then made one of two free throws with 41 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Bowling Green threatened for 10 seconds around the basket, grabbing a series of offensive rebounds and surviving a Charles Bassey blocked shot before Caleb Fields tipped the ball home, cutting the lead to 75-74</p>
      <p>The Hilltoppers missed a free throw that Turner rebounded and drove hard downcourt, pulling up at the free throw line to arc his winning jumper over a defender.</p>
      <p>Taveion Hollingsworth had 19 points for the Hilltoppers (4-1), whose four-game season-opening win streak was broken. Charles Bassey added 19 points with 12 rebounds, four assists, three blocks and three steals. Carson Williams had 14 points.</p>
      <p>Bowling Green matches up against Cincinnati Saturday while Western Kentucky meets Illinois State as the tournament continues.</p>
