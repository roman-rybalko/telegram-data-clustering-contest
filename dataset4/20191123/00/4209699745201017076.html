      <p>Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has cautioned Nigerians with dual citizenship against applying for the e-passport.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Nigerian High Commission in Tokyo, Japan, during the launch of the e-passport, the minister told Nigerians with Japanese citizenship that a new visa regime that would grant them multiple entries into Nigeria up to the validity of their Japanese passports would commence soon.</p>
      <p>He said, “I am aware that Japan does not accept dual citizenship, although Nigeria does. Because of this, I urge every Nigerian who renounces he or her Nigerian citizenship not to apply for the e-passport at this centre or anywhere.</p>
      <p>“I will like to assure those Nigerian-Japanese who have accepted Japanese citizenship that a new visa regime that will grant them multiple entries into Nigeria up to the validity of their Japanese passports will commence soon.”</p>
      <p>Aregbesola said the government had received several requests from both the Nigerian community and the Nigerian Embassy in Japan on the need to open a passport issuance centre in Tokyo due to the distance Nigerians had to cover in order to obtain one.</p>
      <p>In response to these requests, Aregbesola explained that President Muhammadu Buhari, in his commitment to the citizens and ease of doing business, approved the issuance of both e-passports and biometric visa in Japan, according to a report by PUNCH.</p>
      <p>He added, “Suffice to say that this provision and service is not limited to Tokyo, Japan; we will open another e-passport and biometric visa facilities in our embassy in Seoul, South Korea, bringing to a total of 44 foreign missions, 43 local and four front offices where Nigeria Immigration Service issues passports to our citizens.”</p>
