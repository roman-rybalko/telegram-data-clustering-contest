      <h1>Olympic stars headline London debut of swimming’s answer to T20 cricket</h1>

        <i>• London Aquatics centre hosts International Swimming League<br/>• Adam Peaty, Chad le Clos and Katinka Hosszu to take part</i>
      </p>
      <p>London hosts the inaugural International <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/swimming">Swimming</a> League this weekend, a concept that hopes to do for swimming what T20 did for cricket. The fast-paced new format involving some of the world’s most decorated swimmers takes place in front of a capacity crowd at the London Aquatics Centre and will feature pyrotechnics, music and back-to-back races.</p>
      <p>The ISL is the brainchild of the Ukrainian energy billionaire Konstantin Grigorishin and pits teams from different nations against each other with London marking the final European leg, before the ISL grand final in Las Vegas next month.</p>
      <p>The series, aimed at bringing the sport into the mainstream sporting cycle, has received much praise from the swimming community, bringing on board the Olympic champions Chad le Clos and Katinka Hosszu as well as Britain’s 2016 Olympic gold medallist Adam Peaty, a world record holder and eight-times world champion.</p>
      <p>While the ISL has been warmly greeted by the superstars of swimming, the sports governing body, Fina, has been less welcoming, initially threatening to ban anyone who took part before eventually backing down. But the competitors in the ISL are looking to cooperate with Fina, not compete with them.</p>
      <p>The Australian three-times Olympic relay gold medallist Cate Campbell, who is part of the London Roar team alongside Peaty, said the new competition has been a breath of fresh air to the sport.</p>
      <p>“It’s been so much fun to be involved,” the 27-year-old said. “It’s a sport that is often quite resistant to change. This idea and concept has encountered quite a lot of resistance. There has been a lot of talk about the rivalry or the battle between Fina and ISL. We want to grow the sport globally, we want to make it better for the athletes, better for the fans, better for the young, up-and-coming swimmers and that is why I am a part of this.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t done it to stab my nose at Fina and that is not the point of joining a league like this. It is about thinking we can do something better, we can create change, we can shake up the playing field a little bit.”</p>
      <p>Grigorishin talked positively about the potential for the series in the future. “This is the first step because eight clubs is not enough. Next season we are planning to organise for 10 clubs [team franchises], potentially up to 12. The season will start in the middle of September and finish at the beginning of April. This is financially sustainable.”</p>
