      <p>Everybody surrounding the lovebirds is clapping and cheering, and it appears that the birthday celebration was a big success.</p>
      <p>David also shared the video on his Instagram page and added a caption saying it was another fantastic Taco Tuesday for them, he also jokingly urged viewers to see how Tamar is grabbing his shirt at the end of the footage because according to his words: “lil mamma can’t get enough of this sugar,” and he stated that he could not get enough of her too.</p>

And baby, I can’t ever seem to get enough of you too❤️❤️🔥🔥….thanks for a terrific start to birthday week. 🕺🏾💃🏼�.�💥🍸🥃”</p>
      <p>Tamar also posted a funny clip where she shared: “Ain’t no damn way I’m giving up meat for processed sodium-filled “vegan meat”….that’s PROCESSED to taste like my delicious cow 🐄😋!!! I’m tired of my vegan friends, and MAN @david.adefeso looking at me crazy and think they are BETTER THAN ME cause I ate a steak. 🙄Well, do you know wtf you are eating??🤷🏽‍♀️ #pickyourpoison it’s all fcked up. Anyway, the birthday week fun begins my love❤️🌟*pulls up at Burger King for the REAL whopper Periodt*?.?😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣”</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that the couple has shown that they are not ashamed of their passionate love, as they posted another video in May, showing them kissing on a beach.</p>
      <p>And with so much affection surrounding these two, a lot of fans started speculating that there may be a wedding coming soon, especially since Braxton said in an interview that she is not ruling marriage out.</p>
