      <p>Legendary fish locations (often referred to as legendary fish RDR2) are not easy to spot in Red Dead Redemption 2. With so many bodies of water both big and small, players could wander endlessly and not find them all. In this guide, we'll help you find all the legendary fish your horse can carry.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Before catching any sort of legendary fish, players will need to have met the stranger named Jeremy Gill and opened up the quest called <b>A Fisher of Fish</b>. This is accomplished over at Gill Landing, New Hanover, on the north shore of the Flat Iron Lake. Mr. Gill will give players a legendary fish map so they can track down each fish, but that map isn't very specific. We've included the locations of each legendary fish with their own map.</p>

      <p>Catching Legendary Fish in Red Dead Redemption 2 requires the use of three specific lures: the <b>Special Lake Lure</b>, the <b>Special River Lure</b>, and the <b>Special Swamp Lure</b>. Simply put, players will not catch any legendary fish without these lures. Fortunately, they aren't too hard to find: after players meet Gill, the Special Lures can be purchased for $20 each at the bait shop in New Hanover, in the area known as Bayou Nwa, around the middle of Lake Lagras.</p>

      <p>Any of the three special lures can be used to catch any of the legendary fish. However, using the right lure stands a greater chance of catching a legendary fish, or of catching one more quickly. The correct lure for each fish type can be found alongside the fish's location in the listings below.

      <p>There's a good reason why we've listed the Legendary Catfish outside of the standard alphabetical order: it's because players can't actually catch one until they've caught and mailed off all 13 other fish. Once they have, Jeremy will send an invite to the hero asking to meet up at his fishing hut. Once arrived, the duo will make a trip to Rio Bravo where they'll be able to catch the Legendary Catfish.</p>
