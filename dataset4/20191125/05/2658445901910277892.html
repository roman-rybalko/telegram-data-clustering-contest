      <p>It is worrisome that the outcome of last week’s elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states did not deviate substantially from the recriminations that had characterized our elections overtime. Neither were they devoid of the unwholesome tendencies that cast serious slur on the future of democracy on these shores.</p>
      <p>Not unexpectedly, incidents of killing, maiming, harassment, hijacking of ballot boxes, vote buying and outright rewriting and falsification of election results were the drawbacks freely traded. At least 10 people were killed in Kogi State including the woman leader of the main opposition party who was burnt alive in her home two days after the elections by suspected party thugs.</p>
      <p>The fatalities were less in Bayelsa State but peace still took flight as a result of electoral violence with many critically injured. International observers under the platform, ‘Diplomatic Watch’ decried the high level of violence in the two states; vote buying, killings in some polling units and credible reports on ballot box snatching. The group which included the EU, US and UK expressed sympathy for all those affected by the violence and called on the government to provide a fair and safe playing ground where all Nigerians would be able to exercise their fundamental rights to vote unencumbered.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere security agencies have also been taking a fair share of the blame for not rising to the challenges posed by these grave security infractions. The police and the military have been fingered by the opposition for aiding some politicians to rig the elections with brazen impunity. Even with the deployment of more than 30, 000 security personnel for the elections, armed thugs still operated feely in their vehicles without being apprehended despite the usual restrictions on movement.</p>
      <p>The Inspector-General of Police IGP, Muhammad Adamu did not help matters when he told reporters that the police had prior intelligence that the elections in Kogi and Bayelsa were going to be violent. If the police had such prior information and we are still left with this embarrassing level of killings and all manner of criminal infractions, it means either they did not take the required proactive steps to arrest the situation or where such responses were undertaken, they were not sufficient to elicit the required outcomes. Whichever the case, the police found itself wanting in providing peaceful and safe ground for the electorate to exercise their franchise without fear of harassment or intimidation. That much is incontrovertible and has been given ample credence by international observers.</p>
      <p>Adamu also rationalized the presence of helicopters during the elections on the ground that they were meant to frighten and scare away would-be ballot box snatchers and other elements intent on causing trouble. We may have to concede this claim to that security organization. But the outcome of the elections showed that the gun-boat diplomacy of the police failed to produce the required results as electoral infractions were at an all time high during the elections. It is clear the helicopters did not quite succeed in scaring away trouble makers given the high level of violence that marred the exercise.</p>
      <p>If one may ask, how many of those election violators were the helicopters able to detect and trace to their final rigging destinations and how many arrests were made? We ask these questions because with the superior air power of the helicopters, the police should have been able not only to neutralize the army of marauding thugs that moved with vehicles during the elections but pursued and smoked them out from their rigging hideouts. It appears none of these happened or we are yet to be told so.</p>
      <p>The police and the military have also been fighting allegations that they aided and abetted the malfeascence. The usual thing we hear after such elections is that impersonators are sometimes misconstrued as police and military personnel. Adamu went along this line when he said the police anticipated this and made tags for its personnel. But the overall responsibility for arresting such impostors still rests squarely on the shoulders of the security agencies. So, no matter how hard they strive to exculpate themselves from the mess, they still share vicarious responsibilities.</p>
      <p>It is the duty of security agencies to make it difficult for imposters of all hue to have a field day during elections. It is also their duty to apprehend and bring to book all those who make it impossible for the collective will of the people as expressed at the ballot box to triumph. Unless serious steps are taken to ensure the sanctity of elections, the increasing culture of violence will get to a level where the people will lose confidence in the entire exercise. And we are getting to that point.</p>
      <p>Events of the 2019 general elections and the outcome of the Kogi and Bayelsa polls are increasingly conjuring the miserable impression that all one requires to win elections is brute force irrespective of the number of deaths recorded. Contrary to the visionary and patriotic statement credited to former president, Goodluck Jonathan, we are now being made to believe that the election of some persons is worth the blood of as many Nigerians as are perceived obstacles to election winning by hook and crook.</p>
      <p>That is all we are contending with now. Where do we place the blame and who takes responsibility for the militarization and bastardization of the electoral process?  Who do we hold responsible if things go awry during elections?  We ask because of the recrimination between the main opposition party and the government on events of the last elections. The Peoples Democratic Party PDP had rejected the results of the elections, accusing the government of rigging and sponsoring the violence that ensued.</p>
      <p>But the presidency responded by accusing it of being a bad loser. For the Senior Special Assistant on Media to the president, Garba Shehu, “It has become a standard procedure for party to challenge any poll that does not return its candidate. Elections are good when the PDP wins. The opposite is the case when any other party wins”.</p>
      <p>Whereas one can admit the ruinous culture of not accepting defeat at elections by our politicians, often accounting for embarrassing litigations, it will be uncharitable to hide under this to cover up the monumental infractions recorded in the just concluded elections. And as evidently admitted by Shehu, democracy is not just about who wins or loses but the process. The grouse with the elections is the process. And we cannot possibly gloss over who wins or who loses when there are serious shortcomings in the process that brought about winners and losers. They are two sides of the same coin.</p>
      <p>Those who fault the outcome of elections in the two states have serious issues with the processes leading to and culminating in the announcement of winners and losers and not necessarily the political parties or individuals that won. And there is no way we can ignore the rules for free, fair and credible conduct without compromising the sovereignty of the electorate. These constitute the lynchpin of the democratic order.</p>
      <p>And in these complaints, the electoral commission, security agencies, the federal government, the presidency and individual politicians share the blame for reasons that are not hard to fathom. If they did their duties to the satisfaction of everyone, there would be no need for the complaints. You cannot beat a child and prevent him from crying. In verity, the overall outcome of the Kogi and Bayelsa polls fell short of the standard tests for a free, fair and credible conduct.</p>
      <p>A voyage on dissent muzzling after the damage has been done is meaningless. The right thing is for the government to work with the National Assembly to facilitate amendments to the Electoral Act; changes that will sufficiently keep at bay the embarrassing infractions witnessed. President Buhari pleaded time constraints for not assenting to the 2018 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill. Had that bill been assented to, we may have been saved the current pass. Now is the time for him to show good faith if he wants democracy to survive.</p>
