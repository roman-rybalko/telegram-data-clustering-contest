      <p>When the Second Niger Bridge is completed, it is one gift that will keep the President<b> Muhammadu Buhari </b>administration in the minds of millions of Southerners for a long time, writes <i><b>CHINEDU ELEKWACHI</b></i></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) Managing Director Uchechi Orji last Thursday said the National Economic Council (NEC) has approved additional investment of $250 million for the agency. Orji, who spoke at the end of the NEC meeting presided over by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, said the Second Niger Bridge was one of the projects that led to the injection of the fund. The Second Niger Bridge is a  Federal Government project.</p>
      <p>The project awarded in March, 2014 is a crucial national infrastructure with immense socio-economic benefits for the contiguous states and the nation.</p>
      <p>Upon completion, the bridge will ease traffic flow, improve road safety and create greater opportunities for local residents by advancing the commercial viability and regenerating economic boom.</p>
      <p>The scope of work includes the construction of 1.6 km long bridge, 10.3 km Highway, Owerri interchange and a toll station.</p>
      <p>The project, estimated to cost about N220 billion and handled by Julius Berger Plc, was initially billed for completion in March, 2018.</p>
      <p>Although it has experienced some delays, the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has, however, shown greater commitment to ensure its completion.</p>
      <p>According to the NSIA, the bridge, which is planned to span Asaba in Delta State and Onitsha in Anambra State, would be completed and delivered within the next 48 months, going by the current approved schedule for the project.</p>
      <p>Orji said the project would be completed and ready for use in 2022.</p>
      <p>Speaking shortly after an inspection of the project in company of the Obi of Onitsha, Nnaemeka Achebe and some of his chiefs, Orji said N33 billion has so far been released for the implementation of the project.</p>
      <p>He expressed optimism that the project would not experience further delay, even as he added that private sector funding to be raised by 2020 through bond and equity is on the card.</p>
      <p>Orji explained that already, a Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) to be managed by the NSIA has been set up for five critical road and power projects across the country.</p>
      <p>He said the PIDF  with a seed funding of $650 million was targeted to catalyse funding for the second Niger Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, East-West Road, Abuja-Kano Road and Mambilla Hydroelectric Power.</p>
      <p>He said the PIDF would eliminate the risks of project funding, cost variation and completion that have plagued the development of the nation’s critical infrastructure assets.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Second Niger Bridge project was conceived to provide an alternative  crossing between Asaba and Onitsha within reasonable distance from the current bridge.</p>
      <p>“It is expected to spur investments, agriculture and trade, particularly with the Onitsha main market in the region, due to the improved and quicker access.</p>
      <p>“There are three phases of the Second Niger Bridge. The first one is the 11.9 kilometer bridge connecting Asaba and Onitsha. The entire work is a 44km project.</p>
      <p>“The mobilisation for the project was released in August. We are confident that the funding is more stable now and we are looking at a completion date of 2022; it’s a big project.”</p>
      <p>The government is also managing challenges from host communities that are demanding compensation.</p>
      <p>The communities recently shut down activities at the Julius Berger Construction Company, Bridge Head, Onitsha in Anambra State in protest against what they called a failure of the company and its Project Director, Mr. Fredrich Wieser, to keep to the agreement they reached.</p>
      <p>Ten communities accused the Director of high handedness, refusal to keep to the local content agreement with them and discrimination in the discharge of his duties.</p>
      <p>The host communities comprise five from Anambra State, namely Onitsha, Obosi, Okpoko, Harbour and Odoekpe, while the other five consisting of Oko Amakom, Asaba, Idoko Madu, Power Line and Okwei are from Delta State.</p>
      <p>They said members of staff of Julius Berger were not welcomed in the communities and must leave until the disagreement was resolved.</p>
      <p>During the protest, they displayed placards with various inscriptions such as: “Wieser must go, he is arrogant”; “The Project Director is a racist”; “Project Director does not respect the host communities”; “Host communities are not beggars” and “Julius Berger does not respect the terms of the MoU with host communities” among others.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>While the protest was ongoing, some workers, who alleged that they were being subjected to all kinds of ill-treatment by the Project Director and his foreign counterparts took the advantage and joined in solidarity.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson of the communities Mr. Peter Okafor said the communities want the Project Director to leave Onitsha and be replaced by somebody who is approachable and can deal with the communities respectfully.</p>
      <p>“Julius Berger and its Project Director, Mr. Wieser have been maltreating the communities. They use the Project Director to deny the communities their rights. The man is unapproachable, and lacks respect for the host communities. He does not respect the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) the communities have with them.</p>
      <p>“He sacked almost 90 per cent skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled indigenous workers, contrary to our local content agreement. He has been employing his friends and foreigners. We are supposed to be given contracts such as supplying of sand, stones and other small contracts as contained in the local content agreement; but he has refused to honour the agreement.”</p>
      <p>The Liaison Officer for Onitsha Community and Adazi Ogulani of Onitsha, Dr. Chuma Agbakoba and his Delta State counterpart, Mr. Henry Enebeli, said Wieser must leave for work to continue otherwise work must stop.</p>
      <p>“We are not saying that work should stop on the Second Niger Bridge, but we are saying that Wieser must leave because he has no regard for the host communities and does not have good manner of approach to the communities. Above all, he exhibits racist behaviours and we can no more tolerate that.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Wieser is very high handed. There are a lot of benefits the host communities would have derived from the project which the Project Director is denying us, and other local content agreements we entered with the company which he has been denying us. We want him to be replaced by another person,” he said.</p>
      <p>Enebeli said: “Some of our communities cannot access their homes in Delta State because the roads to their communities have been blocked with sand and we have been begging and writing the Project Director since July to instruct his men to clear the heaps of sand so that we can access our communities. But he ignored us; we use canoe to move in our area now.</p>
      <p>“We appealed to him that instead of sacking our people on redundancy because he is saying they are not working because of the rains, he should give them time off so that they can start work when the rains are over but he refused.”</p>
      <p>The Controller, Federal Ministry of Works in Anambra State, Adeyemo Ajani, appealed for government’s urgent intervention following the crisis occasioned by the protests.</p>
      <p>He expressed fears over the completion of the project as scheduled if government does not intervene.</p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
        <b>He said: “Work stopped at the site because the host communities are demanding projects worth N500 million while workers are demanding promotion and increase in allowances.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>“In fact, the demands of the host communities are complicated and can only be handled by the Federal Government.”</p>
      <p>Ajani further revealed that each community was demanding projects worth N50 million, which would amount to N500 million.</p>
      <p>“Where can such money come from? Even the works tender board cannot approve that kind of money. It is only the government that can address it and that is why we call on the government to solve the problem,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Controller, however, noted that the project does not have any issue in terms of funding, if not for the delay from the communities through their agitations and demands.</p>
      <p>“Among all the presidential initiative funding projects, the Second Niger Bridge is the only one that has no problem in terms of funding,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also revealed that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the communities and the contractors are yet to be signed due to the demands.</p>
      <p>He urged workers on site to be patient with the contractors on their demands, expressing optimism that their demands would not be a problem since they were being looked into.</p>
      <p>Ajani revealed to <i>The Nation</i> that the challenges posed by the host communities had been resolved following a meeting Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano.</p>
      <p>“We had a meeting with His Excellency and all the host communities where all issues were resolved. A Memorandum of Understanding was equally signed thereafter.”</p>
      <p>He reassured that the 2022 deadline would be achieved.</p>
      <p>“Work has been going on at the site even with the high water level. As we speak, the access road to Asaba is almost completed. The project might even be completed before the scheduled date.”</p>
      <p>Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi said the construction of the Bridge by President Buhari’s administration was no longer a political talk.</p>
      <p>Umahi, who spoke while receiving the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chief Femi Gbajabiamila, commended Buhari for ensuring that the Second Niger Bridge project became a reality in the Southeast.</p>
      <p>He said: “Every week, the Chief of Staff to the President sends me progress report on the project as it is no longer a political talk.”</p>
      <p>An Onitsha resident, Chief Uche Onuorah, wondered why some people could stop work at the bridge that had been the demand of all Southeasterners.</p>
      <p>“The bridge is one of the things the Southeast is seriously demanding from the Federal Government and they are doing it,” he said.</p>
      <p>He urged the various communities to channel their grievances in such a way that work would not be disrupted.</p>
